## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS FOR PM/RND MANAGER**

### **Option A: Spawn Agents Now** (Recommended)
1. Open 2 new Claude chat sessions
2. Paste Dev1 spawn prompt in Chat 1
3. Paste Dev2 spawn prompt in Chat 2
4. Let them read onboarding
5. Create task briefs as they need them
6. Begin Day 2 parallel development

### **Option B: Prepare All Task Briefs First**
1. Create all 8 task briefs (4-6 hours work)
2. Then spawn both agents
3. They have everything immediately
4. Smoother start but delayed by 1 day

### **Option C: Hybrid Approach** (Most Practical)
1. Create Day 2 task briefs only:
   - SCRAPE-002 (Dev1)
   - SCRAPE-005 (Dev2)
2. Spawn both agents
3. They start Day 2 work
4. Create remaining briefs during Day 2

**RND Manager Recommendation:** Option C - Create Day 2 briefs, spawn agents, create others as needed
