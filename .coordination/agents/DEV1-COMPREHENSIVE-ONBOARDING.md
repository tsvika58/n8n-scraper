3. **Storage Layer** - Database operations and data persistence
4. **Unit Testing** - Test infrastructure and coverage
5. **Batch Scraping** - Production batch execution (Batches 2 & 4)

**Why You:** Layers 1 & 2 are more straightforward technically, and you excel at systematic infrastructure work.

---

## üß™ **TESTING REQUIREMENTS**

### **Unit Testing (Your Responsibility):**

**For Every Module You Build:**
- ‚úÖ Write tests WHILE coding (TDD approach)
- ‚úÖ Target 90%+ coverage for your modules
- ‚úÖ Test happy path AND edge cases
- ‚úÖ Test error handling and retries
- ‚úÖ Use real n8n.io data (not mocks)

**Test Structure:**
```python
# tests/unit/test_layer1_metadata.py

import pytest
from src.scrapers.layer1_metadata import PageMetadataExtractor

class TestPageMetadataExtractor:
    @pytest.fixture
    def extractor(self):
        return PageMetadataExtractor()
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_extract_basic_metadata(self, extractor):
        """Test extraction of basic metadata from real workflow"""
        result = await extractor.extract("2462", "https://n8n.io/workflows/2462")
        
        assert result['success'] is True
        assert 'title' in result['data']
        assert 'author' in result['data']
        assert 'primary_category' in result['data']
        # ... test all 19 fields
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_extract_handles_missing_fields(self, extractor):
        """Test graceful handling of missing optional fields"""
        # Test with workflow that might have missing data
        result = await extractor.extract("test-id", "https://n8n.io/workflows/test-id")
        
        # Should still succeed with partial data
        assert result['success'] is True or result['error'] is not None
```

### **Integration Testing (Day 5 - With RND Manager):**

**Test Your Layers Together:**
```python
# tests/integration/test_layer1_layer2_integration.py

@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_complete_layer1_layer2_extraction():
    """Test Layers 1 & 2 work together"""
    layer1 = PageMetadataExtractor()
    layer2 = WorkflowJSONExtractor()
    
    workflow_id = "2462"
    url = "https://n8n.io/workflows/2462"
    
    # Extract both layers
    l1_result = await layer1.extract(workflow_id, url)
    l2_result = await layer2.extract(workflow_id, url)
    
    assert l1_result['success'] is True
    assert l2_result['success'] is True
    
    # Verify data consistency
    assert l1_result['data']['title'] == l2_result['data']['workflow_json']['name']
```

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **STRICTNESS LEVELS & ENFORCEMENT**

### **ZERO TOLERANCE VIOLATIONS (Automatic Rejection):**
1. **False Test Results** - claiming tests pass when they fail
2. **Mock Data in Evidence** - using fake n8n data instead of real scraping
3. **Inflated Metrics** - claiming higher success rates than actual
4. **Skipping Testing** - submitting without running tests
5. **Old Evidence** - using test results from previous sessions

### **CONSEQUENCES:**
- **First Violation:** Task rejected, rework required, trust reduced
- **Second Violation:** All future tasks require pre-approval from RND Manager
- **Third Violation:** Removed from project

### **ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS:**
- **Test Output Review:** RND Manager verifies test files
- **Timestamp Validation:** Evidence must be fresh
- **Real Data Verification:** Spot checks on extracted data
- **Cross-Reference:** Claims verified against evidence files

## üí° **TIPS FOR SUCCESS**

### **Technical Tips:**
1. **Use Playwright's auto-waiting** - reduces flakiness
2. **Test with diverse workflows** - not just one example
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - some workflows may have missing data
4. **Log everything** - use the logging system from SCRAPE-001
5. **Keep functions small** - easier to test and debug

### **Process Tips:**
1. **Test continuously** - don't wait until end of day
2. **Save evidence as you go** - test outputs, sample data
3. **Update handoff file frequently** - keep RND Manager informed
4. **Ask questions early** - don't waste hours being blocked
5. **Be honest about progress** - better to ask for help than miss deadline

### **Collaboration Tips:**
1. **Respect Dev2's work** - don't modify Layer 3 code
2. **Clear interfaces** - RND Manager defines how layers connect
3. **Integration on Day 5** - your work meets Dev2's work
4. **Mock testing before** - test Layer 1+2 with mock Layer 3 data

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REMINDERS**

### **NEVER:**
- Submit without running tests
- Use mock n8n data (must scrape real site)
- Claim tests pass if they don't
- Skip evidence collection
- Miss daily coordination updates
- Work on Dev2's tasks (Layer 3, OCR, video)

### **ALWAYS:**
- Navigate to project root before starting
- Activate virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate`)
- Run tests before committing code
- Save test outputs to evidence folder
- Update handoff file EOD
- Communicate blockers immediately

### **REMEMBER:**
- Quality over speed - better to deliver tested code late than broken code on time
- Evidence-based reporting - show test outputs, not claims
- Honest communication - RND Manager is here to help, not judge
- Team success - you and Dev2 succeed together

---

## üéØ **PROJECT SUCCESS DEPENDS ON YOU**

**Your Layers 1 & 2 are the foundation:**
- Dev2's Layer 3 depends on your work being solid
- Integration on Day 5 depends on your code quality
- Final dataset depends on your extraction accuracy

**Without solid Layers 1 & 2:**
- Layer 3 has nothing to attach to
- Integration fails
- Project fails

**With excellent Layers 1 & 2:**
- Dev2 can build on solid foundation
- Integration succeeds
- Project delivers 2,100+ workflows

**You are critical to project success.** üöÄ
