## 📋 **SELF-VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS (I UNDERSTAND)**

### **7-Step Process Before Every Submission:**

**Step 1: Code Exists ✅**
- Verify implementation + test files exist
- Check for syntax errors
- Run: `ls -la [files]` and `python -m py_compile [files]`

**Step 2: Tests Pass ✅**
- Run tests and **WATCH them execute** (never pipe without watching)
- Verify 100% pass rate
- Check final summary line

**Step 3: Coverage Meets Target ✅**
- Run coverage and **WATCH output**
- Verify meets or exceeds target %
- Write down actual percentage

**Step 4: Evidence Files Created ✅**
- Create all 4 required files
- Test output, coverage report, sample output, evidence summary
- Verify all exist with `ls -la`

**Step 5: Numbers Match ✅**
- Test count matches between files
- Coverage % matches between files
- No discrepancies anywhere

**Step 6: Requirements Met ✅**
- Check each requirement individually
- Mark PASS/FAIL for each
- All must be PASS

**Step 7: Final Check ✅**
- Read entire task brief again
- Confirm ALL checkboxes checked
- Ready to defend all claims
- Prepared to show reproducible results

**I commit:** I will complete all 7 steps before every submission to RND.

## 📁 **STANDARD EVIDENCE FORMAT (I UNDERSTAND)**

### **4 Mandatory Files for EVERY Task:**

**1. `[TASK-ID]-test-output.txt`** ⭐
- **How:** `pytest tests/[module] -v > .coordination/testing/results/[TASK-ID]-test-output.txt`
- **Contains:** All test names, results, final summary
- **Must show:** 100% pass rate
- **I will:** Create this for every task

**2. `[TASK-ID]-coverage-report.txt`** ⭐
- **How:** `pytest --cov=src.[module] --cov-report=term-missing > .coordination/testing/results/[TASK-ID]-coverage-report.txt`
- **Contains:** Coverage %, line numbers, module stats
- **Must show:** Coverage ≥ target
- **I will:** Create this for every task

**3. `[TASK-ID]-sample-output.json`** ⭐
- **How:** Task-specific commands to generate
- **Contains:** Example output from my code
- **Must show:** Valid JSON with required fields
- **I will:** Create this for every task

**4. `[TASK-ID]-evidence-summary.json`** ⭐
- **How:** Manually create with exact template structure
- **Contains:** All metrics, test results, deliverables, self-validation
- **Must show:** Actual numbers (not estimates)
- **I will:** Create this with accurate data for every task

**Location:** `.coordination/testing/results/` for all files

**I commit:** I will create all 4 files with accurate data before every submission.

## 🧪 **TESTING PROTOCOL (I UNDERSTAND)**

### **Critical Process:**

**ALWAYS:**
```bash
# Step 1: Watch tests run FIRST
pytest tests/[module] -v

# Step 2: Watch coverage FIRST
pytest tests/[module] --cov=src.[module] --cov-report=term-missing

# Step 3: ONLY after seeing both pass, save to files
pytest tests/[module] -v > evidence-file.txt
pytest tests/[module] --cov=... > coverage-file.txt
```

**NEVER:**
```bash
# Bad: Piping without watching (can't see if stuck!)
pytest ... > file.txt
```

**Why:** Need to see tests execute live, catch issues immediately, avoid stuck terminals

**I commit:** I will always watch tests run live before saving to evidence files.

---

## ✅ **APPROVAL CRITERIA (I UNDERSTAND)**

### **What Gets First-Time Approval:**

- ✅ All evidence files exist and complete
- ✅ Numbers match exactly (no discrepancies)
- ✅ Tests 100% pass when RND runs them
- ✅ Coverage meets or exceeds target
- ✅ All requirements fully met
- ✅ Results are reproducible

**I understand:** RND will independently verify everything. My claims must be backed by real evidence.

---

## 🚨 **REJECTION CRITERIA (I UNDERSTAND)**

### **What Causes Instant Rejection:**

- ❌ Missing any required evidence files
- ❌ Numbers don't match between files
- ❌ Even ONE test failing (need 100%)
- ❌ Coverage below target (even by 0.01%)
- ❌ Can't reproduce results
- ❌ Any requirement incomplete
- ❌ "Almost done" submissions (95% = 0%)

**I understand:** All requirements are mandatory. Partial completion = rejection. No exceptions.

## 📊 **WHAT I LEARNED FROM SCRAPE-005**

### **My Journey:**

**Initial Submission (Rejected):**
- Success rate: 75% ❌
- Coverage: 85.23% ⚠️
- Workflows: 8 ❌
- Issues: Unclear on targets, insufficient testing

**Rework (Approved):**
- Success rate: 100% ✅ (+25%)
- Coverage: 97.35% ✅ (+12%)
- Workflows: 20 ✅ (+150%)
- Result: Exceeded all requirements

**What Went Right:**
- Thorough testing (20 workflows)
- High coverage (97%)
- Honest reporting
- Professional execution
- Complete failure analysis

**What Caused Initial Rejection:**
- Unclear targets (I assumed vs asking)
- Insufficient workflow count
- Coverage marginally above minimum

**How New Process Prevents This:**
- Clear requirements from start ("≥90% success")
- Exact targets specified ("15-20 workflows")
- Coverage target explicit ("≥88%")
- Self-validation catches issues before submission

**I learned:** The new template would have prevented my initial confusion. I would have known exact targets and likely achieved first-time approval.
