# 📢 **IMPORTANT: NEW TASK PROCESS - ACTION REQUIRED**

**FROM:** RND Manager  
**TO:** Developer-2 (Dev2)  
**DATE:** October 10, 2025, 12:10 AM  
**SUBJECT:** New Task Assignment Process + Excellent Work on SCRAPE-005  
**PRIORITY:** HIGH - READ BEFORE SCRAPE-006

---

## 🎯 **WHY I'M WRITING TO YOU**

Dev2, first - **excellent work on SCRAPE-005!** You delivered 97.35% coverage, 100% success rate, and turned a rejection into an exemplary approval. Well done. 🎉

Now, we're implementing a new task assignment and validation process for all future tasks. This will make the process even smoother and prevent any initial confusion like we had with SCRAPE-005's first submission.

---

## 📋 **WHAT'S CHANGING**

### **Your SCRAPE-005 Journey:**
- Initial submission: 75% success, 85% coverage → Rejected
- Rework: 100% success, 97% coverage → APPROVED
- **You showed excellent recovery and professional execution**

### **What We Learned:**
- Initial confusion about requirements
- Had to clarify success rate targets
- Had to expand workflow testing (8 → 20)
- Coverage needed boost (85% → 97%)

### **The New Process Prevents This:**
- ✅ Crystal-clear requirements from the start
- ✅ Exact success rate targets (e.g., "≥90%")
- ✅ Specific workflow count (e.g., "15-20 workflows")
- ✅ Coverage target explicitly stated
- ✅ Self-validation checklist before submitting
- ✅ Standard evidence format

**Result:** First submissions approved more often, less rework needed

---

## 📚 **NEW TEMPLATE YOU'LL RECEIVE**

### **RND Task Assignment Template**
**Location:** `/Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/path58-coordination/n8n-scraper-project/templates/RND-TASK-ASSIGNMENT-TEMPLATE-v1.md`

**This is what SCRAPE-006 and future tasks will look like:**

**Sections you'll see:**
1. **Your Mission** - One sentence goal
2. **Context & Reference** - Link to PM's original brief
3. **Your Deliverables Checklist** - Exact files to create
4. **Specific Requirements** - Each with verification command
5. **Quality Targets** - Coverage %, success rate, workflow count
6. **Testing Protocol** - How to run tests (watch them!)
7. **Self-Validation Checklist** - 7 steps before submitting
8. **Evidence Files Required** - 4+ standardized files
9. **What Causes Rejection** - Clear instant-reject criteria
10. **What Causes Approval** - Clear approval criteria

**Read time:** 20 minutes  
**Benefit:** No confusion from start, first-time approvals

---

## ✅ **WHAT YOU MUST DO NOW**

### **Action #1: Read the Template (20 min)**
```bash
# Open and read:
open /Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/path58-coordination/n8n-scraper-project/templates/RND-TASK-ASSIGNMENT-TEMPLATE-v1.md
```

**Focus on these sections:**
- **Self-Validation Checklist** (lines 218-294) - You'll do this before every submission
- **Evidence Files Required** (lines 67-137) - You'll create these every time
- **What Causes Approval** (lines 430-445) - How to get first-time approval
- **Testing Protocol** (lines 244-286) - Proper test execution

---

### **Action #2: Understand Standard Evidence Format**

**For EVERY task (including SCRAPE-006), you'll create:**

1. **`[TASK-ID]-test-output.txt`** ⭐ **REQUIRED**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/[module] -v > .coordination/testing/results/[TASK-ID]-test-output.txt
   ```
   
2. **`[TASK-ID]-coverage-report.txt`** ⭐ **REQUIRED**
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src.[module] --cov-report=term-missing > .coordination/testing/results/[TASK-ID]-coverage-report.txt
   ```
   
3. **`[TASK-ID]-sample-output.json`** ⭐ **REQUIRED**
   - Example of your code's output
   - Task-specific format
   
4. **`[TASK-ID]-evidence-summary.json`** ⭐ **REQUIRED**
   - JSON with all metrics
   - Standardized format (template provided in RND template)

**Location:** `.coordination/testing/results/`

**Why:** Standard format makes validation faster and clearer

---

### **Action #3: Learn Self-Validation Process**

**Before submitting to me, complete these 7 steps:**

1. ✅ **Code Exists** - Verify files with ls commands
2. ✅ **Tests Pass** - Run and WATCH pytest -v
3. ✅ **Coverage Met** - Check and WATCH coverage output
4. ✅ **Evidence Created** - Generate all 4+ files
5. ✅ **Numbers Match** - Verify consistency between files
6. ✅ **Requirements Met** - Check each requirement
7. ✅ **Final Check** - Review everything once more

**Why:** Catches issues before my validation, leads to faster approvals

---

### **Action #4: Know Approval Criteria**

**I will APPROVE first-time if:**
- ✅ All evidence files exist and complete
- ✅ Numbers match exactly (no discrepancies)
- ✅ Tests 100% pass (when I run them)
- ✅ Coverage meets or exceeds target
- ✅ All requirements fully met
- ✅ Results are reproducible

**Based on your SCRAPE-005 rework:** You already know how to do this! The new format just makes it clearer from the start.

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: WATCH TESTS RUN**

### **New Mandatory Protocol:**

**ALWAYS:**
```bash
# Step 1: Run tests and WATCH them
pytest tests/module -v

# Step 2: Check coverage and WATCH output
pytest tests/module --cov=src.module --cov-report=term-missing

# Step 3: ONLY after seeing both pass, save to files
pytest tests/module -v > evidence-file.txt
pytest tests/module --cov=... > coverage-file.txt
```

**NEVER:**
```bash
# Bad: Piping without watching first
pytest ... > file.txt  # Can't see if stuck!
```

**You did this correctly in SCRAPE-005 rework.** Keep doing it! 👍

---

## 📊 **YOUR NEXT TASK: SCRAPE-006**

**When I assign SCRAPE-006:**
1. You'll receive: `rnd-to-dev2-SCRAPE-006-TASK-ASSIGNMENT.md`
2. Format: Using new template
3. Contents:
   - Clear objective (OCR & Video Transcripts)
   - Exact requirements with verification commands
   - Quality targets (coverage %, test count, etc.)
   - Evidence files to create
   - Self-validation checklist

**Your Process:**
1. Read PM's original brief (link provided)
2. Read my RND task assignment
3. Ask questions if ANYTHING unclear
4. Execute task following guidelines
5. Complete self-validation

## 📝 **EXAMPLES FOR YOU**

### **How SCRAPE-006 Requirements Will Look:**

**Old Way (Vague):**
> "Add OCR and video transcript extraction with good coverage"

**New Way (Clear):**
> **Requirement #1: OCR Extraction**
> - Extract text from workflow images using OCR
> - Accuracy: ≥85% (measured on test images)
> - How I verify: `pytest tests/test_ocr.py -v`
> - Pass: All tests pass + accuracy ≥85%
> - Fail: Any test fails OR accuracy <85% = REJECTED
>
> **Requirement #2: Test Coverage**
> - Minimum: 88%
> - How to check: `pytest --cov=src.scrapers.layer3_ocr`
> - Pass: ≥88.00%
> - Fail: <88.00% = REJECTED

**See the difference?** You know EXACTLY what's required!
