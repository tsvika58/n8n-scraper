## ðŸŽ¯ Tomorrow's Plan (Day 2 - SCRAPE-005)

**Task:** Layer 3 - Explainer Content Extractor
**Duration:** 8 hours
**Priority:** High

**Planned Activities:**

**Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM):**
1. Morning standup with RND Manager (9:00 AM)
2. Design ExplainerContentExtractor class architecture
3. Research n8n.io workflow page structure (identify iframe patterns)
4. Select 5-10 test workflows with varying complexity
5. Begin implementation of core extraction logic

**Afternoon (1:00 PM - 6:00 PM):**
6. Implement iframe navigation with Playwright
7. Implement text extraction (introduction, overview, tutorial sections)
8. Implement media URL collection (images, videos)
9. Implement hierarchical section structure preservation
10. Begin unit test framework

**Evening:**
11. Evening sync with RND Manager (6:00 PM)
12. Update handoff file with progress
13. Commit code with descriptive messages

**Deliverables Target:**
- `src/scrapers/layer3_explainer.py` (initial 200+ lines)
- Basic iframe navigation working
- 3-5 extraction methods implemented
- Initial test framework setup

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Technical Challenges Anticipated

**For SCRAPE-005:**
1. **Iframe Navigation:** Need to identify correct iframe selector for explainer content
2. **Dynamic Content:** May need to wait for JavaScript loading
3. **Hierarchical Structure:** Preserve parent-child relationships in tutorial sections
4. **Text Aggregation:** Combine all text sources for complete NLP dataset
5. **Edge Cases:** Handle workflows without explainers gracefully

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start with manual inspection of 3-5 workflow pages
- Use Playwright's auto-wait features
- Test with diverse workflows (minimal/rich content)
- Implement robust error handling from start
- Mock data for testing until real extraction works

## ðŸ“‹ Questions for RND Manager

**Before Day 2 Start:**

1. **Task Briefs:** Should I proceed based on the comprehensive onboarding doc, or will you generate separate SCRAPE-005/SCRAPE-006 task briefs?

2. **Dev1 Coordination:** What's Dev1's current status on SCRAPE-002 and SCRAPE-003? Should I coordinate test workflows with them?

3. **Test Workflows:** Do you have a specific list of workflow IDs for testing, or should I select them based on diversity criteria?

4. **Integration Approach:** For testing before Day 5 integration, should I:
   - Create mock Layer 1/2 data structures?
   - Work independently and integrate later?
   - Use real workflow IDs with placeholder metadata?

5. **Daily Standup:** Confirm tomorrow's 9:00 AM standup time and format?
