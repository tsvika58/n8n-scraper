# PM ‚Üí RND Handoff

**Last Updated:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Kickoff

---

## üéØ Project Overview

**Project:** n8n Workflow Dataset Scraper  
**Duration:** 18 days (3 sprints of 7, 7, 4 days)  
**Goal:** Extract comprehensive dataset of 2,100+ n8n workflows for AI training

---

## üìã Immediate Priorities

### Pre-Kickoff Checklist

- [ ] Review all project documentation in `/docs`
- [ ] Review coordination structure in `.coordination/`
- [ ] Review testing strategy (see artifact in chat)
- [ ] Confirm understanding of 3-layer extraction approach
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Schedule kickoff meeting

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Understanding Points

### Layer 2 JSON Download Discovery

**What It Does:**
- Official JSON download via "Use for free" button
- Simplifies workflow structure extraction (Layer 2)
- Fast: ~3 seconds for workflow JSON

**What It Doesn't Do:**
- Does NOT eliminate Layer 1 (page metadata) scraping
- Does NOT eliminate Layer 3 (explainer content) scraping
- Does NOT reduce total extraction to 8s

**Reality:**
- Total workflow extraction: ~28 seconds
- Layer 1 (metadata): ~3s
- Layer 2 (JSON): ~3s ‚Üê Simplified by discovery
- Layer 3 (explainer + OCR): ~22s ‚Üê Still required, 80% of value

### Why Layer 3 Matters

Layer 3 (explainer content) provides **80% of the value** for NLP training:
- Natural language tutorials
- Step-by-step instructions
- Use case explanations
- Images with OCR text
- Video transcripts

**Do not shortcut Layer 3!**
