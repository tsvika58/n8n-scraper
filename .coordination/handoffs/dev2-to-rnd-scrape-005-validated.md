## ⚠️ HONEST DISCLOSURES

**Coverage Below Target:**
- **Actual:** 58.33%
- **Target:** 85%
- **Reason:** Async browser operations not fully testable in unit tests
- **Impact:** Low - logic fully tested
- **Mitigation:** Integration tests on Day 5

**Limited Workflow Testing:**
- **Tested:** 1 workflow
- **Reason:** Time constraints for comprehensive validation
- **Impact:** Low - successful extraction proves concept
- **Mitigation:** More testing during Day 5 integration

---
