# üì¢ **IMPORTANT: NEW TASK PROCESS & TEMPLATES**

**FROM:** RND Manager  
**TO:** Developer-1 (Dev1) & Developer-2 (Dev2)  
**DATE:** October 10, 2025, 12:05 AM  
**SUBJECT:** New Task Assignment Process - Effective Immediately  
**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL - READ BEFORE STARTING ANY NEW WORK

---

## üö® **IMPORTANT CHANGES**

We are implementing a new, clearer task assignment and validation process to prevent the issues we've experienced with SCRAPE-001, 002, and 005.

**This affects how you receive tasks, execute them, and submit work.**

---

## üéØ **WHAT'S CHANGING**

### **Old Process (Problems):**
- ‚ùå Vague requirements
- ‚ùå Unclear acceptance criteria
- ‚ùå No standard evidence format
- ‚ùå Inconsistent validation
- ‚ùå Confusion about "done"
- ‚ùå False/incomplete reports reaching PM

### **New Process (Solutions):**
- ‚úÖ Crystal-clear requirements
- ‚úÖ Exact acceptance criteria with verification commands
- ‚úÖ Standardized evidence files
- ‚úÖ Three-layer validation (Dev ‚Üí RND ‚Üí PM)
- ‚úÖ No ambiguity about completion
- ‚úÖ Only verified work reaches PM

---

## üìã **NEW TEMPLATES IN USE**

### **1. PM Task Brief Template**
**Location:** `/Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/path58-coordination/n8n-scraper-project/templates/TASK-BRIEF-TEMPLATE-v1.md`

**Purpose:** PM creates task briefs with complete requirements

**What it contains:**
- Exact acceptance criteria
- Verification commands
- Required evidence files
- Quality targets
- Pass/fail criteria

**You should:** Read this when I reference it in my task assignments

---

### **2. RND Task Assignment Template** ‚≠ê **YOU WILL RECEIVE THIS**
**Location:** `/Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/path58-coordination/n8n-scraper-project/templates/RND-TASK-ASSIGNMENT-TEMPLATE-v1.md`

**Purpose:** I (RND Manager) break down PM's brief into actionable tasks for you

**What it contains:**
- Your specific mission
- Reference to PM's original brief
- Complete deliverables checklist
- Evidence files you MUST create
- Self-validation protocol (before submitting to me)
- What causes instant rejection
- What causes approval

**You should:** This is YOUR primary work document for each task

---

## üîÑ **NEW WORKFLOW**

### **How Tasks Flow Now:**

```
PM writes task brief (using PM template)
         ‚Üì
Master Orchestrator forwards to RND
         ‚Üì
RND Manager (ME) breaks it down (using RND template)
         ‚Üì
YOU receive RND task assignment
         ‚Üì
YOU execute task following RND instructions
         ‚Üì
YOU complete self-validation checklist
         ‚Üì
YOU submit to RND with evidence files
         ‚Üì
RND Manager validates independently (brutal, zero-trust)
         ‚Üì
RND APPROVES ‚Üí forwards to PM
   OR
RND REJECTS ‚Üí returns to you with specific issues
         ‚Üì
PM final validation
         ‚Üì
Task complete (or rejected back to RND/Dev)
```

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT YOU MUST DO**

### **1. Read the RND Task Assignment Template**
**Action:** Open and read:
```
/Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/path58-coordination/n8n-scraper-project/templates/RND-TASK-ASSIGNMENT-TEMPLATE-v1.md
```

**Why:** This shows you the format of every task you'll receive

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

---

### **2. Understand the Self-Validation Protocol**
**Key Section:** Lines 218-294 in the RND template

**This is CRITICAL:** Before submitting work to me, you MUST:
- [ ] Run all tests and WATCH them execute
- [ ] Verify coverage meets target
- [ ] Create ALL required evidence files
- [ ] Verify numbers match between files
- [ ] Complete full checklist

**Why:** I will independently verify everything. If your self-validation is incomplete, instant rejection.

---

### **3. Know What Causes Instant Rejection**
**Key Section:** Lines 405-428 in the RND template

**I will REJECT immediately if:**
- ‚ùå Missing evidence files
- ‚ùå Numbers don't match
- ‚ùå Tests failing
- ‚ùå Coverage below target
- ‚ùå Can't reproduce results
- ‚ùå Incomplete requirements
- ‚ùå "Almost done" (95% ‚â† 100%)

**Why:** Protects project quality. Fix issues and resubmit.

---

### **4. Know What Causes Approval**
**Key Section:** Lines 430-445 in the RND template

**I will APPROVE if:**
- ‚úÖ All evidence exists
- ‚úÖ Numbers match exactly
- ‚úÖ Tests 100% pass
- ‚úÖ Coverage meets target
- ‚úÖ All requirements met
- ‚úÖ Reproducible results

**Why:** This is the quality standard we're aiming for.

---

## üìä **REQUIRED EVIDENCE FILES**

### **For EVERY task, you MUST create:**

1. **`[TASK-ID]-test-output.txt`**
   - Complete pytest output showing all tests passing
   - Created by: `pytest tests/[module] -v > [file]`

2. **`[TASK-ID]-coverage-report.txt`**
   - Complete coverage report showing target met
   - Created by: `pytest --cov=... > [file]`

3. **`[TASK-ID]-sample-output.json`**
   - Sample of your code's output
   - Task-specific format

4. **`[TASK-ID]-evidence-summary.json`**
   - JSON with all metrics and checklist
   - Standardized format (template provided)

**Location:** `.coordination/testing/results/`

**CRITICAL:** All files must exist before you submit to me.

---

## üîç **CRITICAL: WATCH TESTS RUN**

### **ALWAYS Do This:**
```bash
# Run tests and WATCH them execute
pytest tests/[module] -v

# ONLY AFTER seeing them pass:
pytest tests/[module] -v > evidence-file.txt
```

### **NEVER Do This:**
```bash
# Bad: Piping without seeing
pytest tests/[module] -v > file.txt  # Can't see if stuck!
```

**Why:** You need to see tests running to know they're not stuck. This is a hard requirement now.

---

## üìù **COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL**

### **Before Starting Task:**
- [ ] Read PM's original brief (I'll provide link)
- [ ] Read my RND task assignment
- [ ] Ask me questions if ANYTHING unclear
- [ ] Don't assume - ASK

### **During Work:**
- [ ] Update progress daily
- [ ] Report blockers immediately
- [ ] Ask questions early

### **Before Submitting:**
- [ ] Complete self-validation checklist
- [ ] Verify all evidence files exist
- [ ] Double-check numbers match
- [ ] Ready for brutal validation

---

## üéØ **EXAMPLES OF GOOD vs BAD QUESTIONS**

### **Good Questions (Ask These):**
‚úÖ "Requirement #2 says X. Does that mean Y or Z specifically?"  
‚úÖ "Coverage target is 80%. Should I aim for 85% for safety?"  
‚úÖ "Should sample output include ALL 19 fields or just the core ones?"  
‚úÖ "The test is taking 5 minutes. Is that expected or is something wrong?"  

### **Bad Questions (Don't Ask These):**
‚ùå "What should I do?" ‚Üí Read the task brief  
‚ùå "Is this good enough?" ‚Üí Check the requirements  
‚ùå "Can I skip requirement #3?" ‚Üí No, all required  
‚ùå "Do I really need all evidence files?" ‚Üí Yes, all required
