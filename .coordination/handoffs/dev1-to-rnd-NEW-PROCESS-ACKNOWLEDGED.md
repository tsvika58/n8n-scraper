## 💡 **MY UNDERSTANDING**

### **What Changed:**
The new process provides crystal-clear requirements with:
1. **Specific measurable criteria** (not vague goals)
2. **Verification commands** for every requirement
3. **Standard evidence format** (4+ files in standardized format)
4. **Self-validation checklist** (7 steps before submission)
5. **Clear pass/fail criteria** (no ambiguity)

### **Why It Helps:**
- ✅ **No confusion** about what "done" means
- ✅ **Faster approvals** with standard validation
- ✅ **Less rework** from unclear requirements
- ✅ **Better quality** with structured testing
- ✅ **Professional growth** through proper validation techniques

### **What I'll Do Differently:**

#### **Before Starting Work:**
1. Read PM's original task brief (link provided)
2. Read RND task assignment completely
3. **ASK QUESTIONS** if anything is unclear
4. Acknowledge task and commit to timeline

#### **During Work:**
1. Follow task assignment exactly
2. Test frequently as I code
3. Update progress daily
4. Watch tests run (don't pipe to file first)

#### **Before Submitting:**
1. Complete **7-step self-validation checklist**:
   - ✅ Verify code exists (ls commands)
   - ✅ Run tests and WATCH them (pytest -v)
   - ✅ Check coverage and WATCH output (pytest --cov)
   - ✅ Create all evidence files
   - ✅ Verify numbers match between files
   - ✅ Confirm all requirements met
   - ✅ Double-check everything
2. Create **4+ standardized evidence files**:
   - `[TASK-ID]-test-output.txt`
   - `[TASK-ID]-coverage-report.txt`
   - `[TASK-ID]-sample-output.json`
   - `[TASK-ID]-evidence-summary.json`
3. Verify all numbers match (no discrepancies)
4. Confirm 100% of checklist complete

## 📊 **EVIDENCE FILES I'LL CREATE**

### **For Every Task:**

**1. Test Output File**
```bash
# Command I'll use:
pytest tests/[module] -v  # Watch first!
pytest tests/[module] -v > .coordination/testing/results/[TASK-ID]-test-output.txt
```

**2. Coverage Report File**
```bash
# Command I'll use:
pytest --cov=src.[module] --cov-report=term-missing  # Watch first!
pytest --cov=src.[module] --cov-report=term-missing > .coordination/testing/results/[TASK-ID]-coverage-report.txt
```

**3. Sample Output File**
- JSON example of my code's output
- Location: `.coordination/testing/results/[TASK-ID]-sample-output.json`

**4. Evidence Summary File**
- JSON with all metrics matching actual output
- Location: `.coordination/testing/results/[TASK-ID]-evidence-summary.json`

---

## 🚫 **WHAT CAUSES INSTANT REJECTION (I'LL AVOID):**

- ❌ Missing evidence files
- ❌ Numbers don't match (claimed vs actual)
- ❌ Tests failing (even one)
- ❌ Coverage below target
- ❌ Can't reproduce my results
- ❌ Incomplete requirements
- ❌ "Almost done" (95% ≠ 100%)

**I understand:** These are quality gates, not personal. If rejected, I'll fix and resubmit.

---

## ✅ **WHAT CAUSES APPROVAL (MY GOAL):**

- ✅ All evidence files present
- ✅ All numbers match exactly
- ✅ All tests passing (100%)
- ✅ Coverage meets/exceeds target
- ✅ Results reproducible
- ✅ All requirements 100% complete
- ✅ Self-validation checklist complete

## 🎯 **SCRAPE-002 STATUS UNDERSTANDING**

### **Current Situation:**
- ✅ I submitted rework completion to you
- ⏳ You're awaiting PM clarification on requirements
- ⏳ PM will provide clear task brief
- ⏳ You'll create task assignment using new template

### **What I'm Waiting For:**
- Your new task assignment: `rnd-to-dev1-SCRAPE-002-TASK-ASSIGNMENT.md`
- Clear requirements with exact criteria
- Standard evidence file specifications
- Self-validation checklist for this specific task

### **What I'll Do When Received:**
1. Read PM's original brief (link you'll provide)
2. Read your task assignment completely
3. Ask clarifying questions BEFORE coding
4. Execute using new self-validation process
5. Create all standardized evidence files
6. Submit for faster approval

**Timeline:** Understood this is waiting on PM, not my delay.

## ❓ **QUESTIONS**

### **Current Questions:**
**Q1:** For SCRAPE-002 specifically, should I wait for your new task assignment before doing any additional work, or should I continue improving coverage toward 80%+ in the meantime?

**Q2:** For the evidence summary JSON file, is there a template or schema I should follow, or will that be provided in each task assignment?

**Q3:** When you say "watch tests run" - should I run tests in one terminal window while preparing evidence files in another, or is the two-step process (watch first, then save to file) the preferred approach?

### **Answers Needed Before:**
- Starting any new work on SCRAPE-002
- Creating evidence files in new format

## 💬 **PERSONAL RESPONSE**

RND Manager,

Thank you for taking responsibility for the requirements confusion on SCRAPE-002 and for creating this comprehensive new process. I really appreciate:

1. **The clarity:** Specific, measurable requirements with verification commands
2. **The structure:** Self-validation checklist ensures I catch issues before you see them
3. **The fairness:** Clear pass/fail criteria so I know exactly what's expected
4. **The support:** Template shows you want me to succeed, not fail

**Your assessment of my work was fair:**
- ✅ Good code quality (extractor works well)
- ✅ Comprehensive tests (34 tests)
- ✅ Honest reporting (all claims accurate)
- ⚠️ Confusion from unclear requirements (not my fault)

**The new process addresses the real issue:** unclear requirements, not my execution.

I'm excited to work on SCRAPE-002 rework with the new format. Having exact criteria and standard evidence format will make it much easier to deliver exactly what's needed.

**I'm committed to making this project successful.** 💪
