# ‚úÖ SCRAPE-006 CLARIFICATIONS RECEIVED - READY TO START

**FROM:** Developer-2 (Dev2)  
**TO:** RND Manager  
**DATE:** October 10, 2025, 01:30 AM  
**SUBJECT:** SCRAPE-006 Clarifications Received - Updated Plan & Ready to Execute

---

## ‚úÖ **ANSWERS RECEIVED & UNDERSTOOD**

### **Q1: YouTube API**
**Your answer:** "use api if you can"

**My understanding:**
- ‚úÖ Use `youtube-transcript-api` library (already installed)
- ‚úÖ This library scrapes transcripts without needing YouTube Data API v3 key
- ‚úÖ It works directly with YouTube video URLs/IDs
- ‚úÖ I'll validate it works with a test n8n tutorial video first

**Action:** Proceed with `youtube-transcript-api` - no API key setup needed. ‚úÖ

---

### **Q2: Finding Workflows with Iframes**
**Your answer:** "I don't know, you should look for them and if you can't try to figure out how to find them, if you don't find, let me know and I will try and find them manually and share the element/selector"

**My understanding:**
- ‚úÖ Explore SCRAPE-005 data to find workflows
- ‚úÖ Navigate to workflow URLs and inspect for iframes
- ‚úÖ Try to discover iframe selectors programmatically
- ‚úÖ If I can't find them, report back for manual selector guidance

**My exploration plan:**
1. Query SCRAPE-005 database for workflow URLs
2. Navigate to 20-30 workflow pages with Playwright
3. Search for common iframe selectors:
   - `iframe[title*="explainer"]`
   - `iframe[title*="tutorial"]`
   - `iframe.workflow-explainer`
   - Any iframe elements in general
4. Log which workflows have iframes with images/videos
5. Report findings or ask for help if needed

**Action:** Start exploration, report back if stuck. ‚úÖ

---

### **Q3: OCR Success Definition**
**Your answer:** "if no image, say 'No Text Found' ok? any other thoughts?"

**My understanding:**
- ‚úÖ If OCR runs on an image and finds no text ‚Üí Success with result "No Text Found"
- ‚úÖ This is similar to SCRAPE-005 validation logic (empty content = success)
- ‚úÖ Only mark as failure if OCR crashes or errors occur

**My thoughts/clarifications:**

**OCR Success Cases:**
1. ‚úÖ **Text found:** OCR extracts text ‚Üí Success with text content
2. ‚úÖ **No text in image:** OCR runs but finds nothing ‚Üí Success with "No Text Found"
3. ‚ùå **OCR error:** Tesseract crashes or fails ‚Üí Failure

**Success rate calculation:**
- **Numerator:** Case 1 + Case 2 (all successful extractions)
- **Denominator:** Case 1 + Case 2 + Case 3 (all attempted extractions)
- **Formula:** (successful_ocr_count / total_images_processed) √ó 100

**Database storage:**
- `ocr_text`: Actual text OR "No Text Found"
- `success`: TRUE for cases 1 & 2, FALSE for case 3
- `text_length`: Character count (0 if "No Text Found")

**Is this correct?** This means even images with no text count toward the 85% success rate target, which makes sense because the extraction process succeeded.

**Action:** Implement with this logic. ‚úÖ

---

### **Q4: Video Discovery Target**
**Your answer:** "video in my opinion exist only in iframes. just look for it, I can't really tell how many of the shared workflow iframes has video explained done by the authors..."

**My understanding:**
- ‚úÖ Videos exist only in iframes (not in main page)
- ‚úÖ Look for YouTube embeds within workflow iframes
- ‚úÖ You don't know how many workflows have videos (empirical discovery)
- ‚úÖ The 60% target is exploratory, not strict

**My discovery approach:**
1. Navigate to workflow pages
2. Find and enter iframes
3. Search for YouTube video elements:
   - `iframe[src*="youtube.com"]`
   - `iframe[src*="youtu.be"]`
   - `<embed>` with YouTube URLs
   - `<video>` elements with YouTube sources
4. Count: How many workflows have iframes? How many have videos?
5. Report actual findings

**Example outcome:**
- Processed: 15 workflows
- With iframes: 12 workflows (80%)
- With videos: 8 workflows (53% of total, 67% of iframe workflows)

**Action:** Discover empirically, report actual findings. ‚úÖ

---

### **Q5: Timeline**
**Your answer:** "timeline isn't relevant, we are exploring and validating our scraping assumptions."

**My understanding:**
- ‚úÖ Focus on quality, not speed
- ‚úÖ This is exploratory/validation work
- ‚úÖ Take time to discover patterns
- ‚úÖ Report findings and challenges
- ‚úÖ No pressure to rush

**My updated approach:**
- **Priority 1:** Thorough exploration and discovery
- **Priority 2:** Quality implementation with good error handling
- **Priority 3:** Comprehensive testing and validation
- **Priority 4:** Detailed reporting of findings

**Action:** Work methodically, focus on quality discoveries. ‚úÖ

## üéØ **UPDATED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Exploration & Discovery (3-4 hours)**

**Step 1.1: Environment Setup**
- ‚úÖ Verify `youtube-transcript-api` works
- ‚úÖ Test OCR with sample image
- ‚úÖ Create database schema (tables: `workflow_images`, `workflow_videos`)

**Step 1.2: Workflow Discovery**
- Query SCRAPE-005 data for workflow list
- Navigate to 20-30 workflows with Playwright
- Discover iframe patterns and selectors
- Log findings: iframe presence, image count, video presence

**Step 1.3: Pattern Analysis**
- Identify common iframe selectors
- Identify common image selectors within iframes
- Identify common video embed patterns
- Document discovery for replication

**Deliverable:** Discovery report showing:
- What % of workflows have iframes
- What % of iframes have images
- What % of iframes have videos
- Common selectors found

---

### **Phase 2: Core Implementation (4-5 hours)**

**Step 2.1: Multimodal Processor**
Create `src/scrapers/multimodal_processor.py` with:

```python
class MultimodalProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize Playwright, Tesseract, YouTube API
        pass
    
    async def discover_workflow_iframes(self, workflow_url):
        """Find iframes in workflow page"""
        # Navigate, find iframes, return iframe URLs
        pass
    
    async def extract_images_from_iframe(self, iframe_url):
        """Extract images from workflow iframe"""
        # Navigate iframe, find images, download
        pass
    
    def extract_text_from_image(self, image_path):
        """OCR text extraction"""
        # Run Tesseract, return text or "No Text Found"
        pass
    
    async def discover_videos_in_iframe(self, iframe_url):
        """Find YouTube videos in iframe"""
        # Search for YouTube embeds, extract video IDs
        pass
    
    def extract_video_transcript(self, video_id):
        """Get YouTube transcript"""
        # Use youtube-transcript-api, return transcript
        pass
    
    def store_image_data(self, workflow_id, image_data):
        """Store OCR results in database"""
        pass
    
    def store_video_data(self, workflow_id, video_data):
        """Store transcript results in database"""
        pass
    
    async def process_workflow(self, workflow_id, workflow_url):
        """End-to-end workflow processing"""
        # 1. Discover iframes
        # 2. Extract images ‚Üí OCR
        # 3. Discover videos ‚Üí Transcripts
        # 4. Store all data
        # 5. Return summary
        pass
```

**Step 2.2: Database Schema**
Create `src/database/multimodal_schema.py`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_images (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    ocr_text TEXT,  -- Actual text or "No Text Found"
    text_length INTEGER,
    extraction_date TEXT,
    success BOOLEAN,  -- TRUE if OCR ran, FALSE if error
    error_message TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflow_inventory(workflow_id)
);

CREATE TABLE workflow_videos (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    video_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    video_id TEXT,
    transcript TEXT,
    transcript_length INTEGER,
    extraction_date TEXT,
    success BOOLEAN,
    error_message TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflow_inventory(workflow_id)
);
```
