# üìã **RND TASK ASSIGNMENT: SCRAPE-002 v2.1**

**RND Task ID:** RND-SCRAPE-002-v2.1  
**PM Task Reference:** PM Task Brief v2.1 - SCRAPE-002 (10 Sales Workflows)  
**Assigned To:** Developer-1 (Dev1)  
**From:** RND Manager  
**Issued Date:** October 10, 2025, 02:10 AM  
**Expected Completion:** October 11, 2025, 18:00  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

## üéØ **YOUR MISSION**

**Extract complete metadata from 10 specific n8n.io sales/lead generation workflows, store in database with 90%+ success rate, 80%+ test coverage, and provide complete evidence package.**

---

## üìö **CONTEXT & REFERENCE**

### **Original PM Task Brief:**
- **Version:** PM Brief v2.1 (received from Master Orchestrator)
- **Scope Change:** Reduced from 50 ‚Üí 10 workflows (strategic decision)
- **Focus:** Sales and lead generation workflows only
- **Read this:** For complete business context and requirements

### **What PM Wants:**
PM needs metadata extracted from 10 pre-selected sales/lead gen workflows to validate the Layer 1 extractor on business-critical workflows before scaling to full production. This is a focused validation phase - full production scraping will happen in SCRAPE-002B after workflow inventory is built.

### **What I Need From You:**
I need ACTUAL evidence of completion on these 10 SPECIFIC workflows:
- 10/10 workflow extractions (I'll verify in database)
- 90%+ success rate (9/10 minimum, 10/10 preferred)
- 80%+ coverage (I'll run pytest --cov myself)
- 35+ tests passing (I'll run pytest -v myself)
- All 6 evidence files exist (I'll check with ls)
- All numbers match (I'll compare your claims vs my verification)

### **Why This Matters:**
This validates your extractor on business-critical sales workflows before production scale. Success here means SCRAPE-002B (full production) will use your proven extractor on hundreds/thousands of workflows.

---

## üéØ **THE 10 TARGET WORKFLOWS**

Extract metadata from these EXACT 10 workflows (all sales/lead gen focused):

| # | Workflow ID | Category | URL |
|---|-------------|----------|-----|
| 1 | **2462** | Lead Scoring & Qualification | https://n8n.io/workflows/2462 |
| 2 | **1954** | Sales Email Automation | https://n8n.io/workflows/1954 |
| 3 | **2103** | CRM Data Sync (Slack) | https://n8n.io/workflows/2103 |
| 4 | **2234** | Email Campaign Management | https://n8n.io/workflows/2234 |
| 5 | **1756** | Lead Enrichment Pipeline | https://n8n.io/workflows/1756 |
| 6 | **1832** | Customer Feedback Collection | https://n8n.io/workflows/1832 |
| 7 | **2156** | Social Media Lead Gen | https://n8n.io/workflows/2156 |
| 8 | **1923** | Sales Invoice Processing | https://n8n.io/workflows/1923 |

| 10 | **2145** | Sales Notification System | https://n8n.io/workflows/2145 |

**Note:** All 10 were validated by Dev2 in SCRAPE-005 - they definitely exist and are accessible.

**Your extraction script should target ONLY these 10 specific workflow IDs.**

3. Find uncovered lines (lines 195-197, 220-222, 229-231, etc.)
4. Write tests that execute those lines
5. Repeat until ‚â•80%

---

### **Requirement #5: 35+ Tests, 100% Passing** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**

**What you must do:**
Implement 2-second delay between requests.

**How I will verify it:**
- Review code for `time.sleep(2)` or similar
- Check total extraction time (10 workflows √ó 2s = ~20s minimum)

**Evidence needed:**
- [ ] Code showing rate limiting
- [ ] Summary JSON shows total_time ‚â• 20s (proves delays happened)

**Pass criteria:** Code has rate limiting AND total time proves it  
**Fail criteria:** No rate limiting or suspiciously fast = **REJECT**

## üß™ **TESTING PROTOCOL**

### **How to Run Tests (Step by Step):**

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to project
cd /Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/Code\ Projects/shared-tools/n8n-scraper

# Step 2: Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 3: Run tests and WATCH them (don't pipe yet!)
pytest tests/unit/test_layer1_metadata.py tests/integration/test_layer1_integration.py -v

# You should SEE each test execute:
# test_extractor_initialization PASSED
# test_extract_basic_metadata PASSED
# ... etc ...

# Step 4: Check coverage and WATCH output
pytest tests/unit/test_layer1_metadata.py --cov=src.scrapers.layer1_metadata --cov-report=term-missing

# You should SEE coverage percentage display
# Must be ‚â• 80.00%

# Step 5: ONLY AFTER seeing everything pass, save to files
pytest tests/unit/test_layer1_metadata.py tests/integration/test_layer1_integration.py -v > .coordination/testing/results/SCRAPE-002-test-output.txt 2>&1
pytest tests/unit/test_layer1_metadata.py --cov=src.scrapers.layer1_metadata --cov-report=term-missing > .coordination/testing/results/SCRAPE-002-coverage-report.txt 2>&1
```

**CRITICAL:** Always watch tests run live first. Never pipe to file without seeing them pass first.

## üö® **WHAT WILL CAUSE INSTANT REJECTION**

‚ùå **Missing ANY of 10 Workflows**
- Must have ALL 10 specific IDs: 2462, 1954, 2103, 2234, 1756, 1832, 2156, 1923, 2087, 2145
- Even 9/10 with wrong ID = REJECTED

‚ùå **Sample Folder Has ‚â†10 Files**
- Must be exactly 10 workflow JSON files
- Less than 10 OR more than 10 = REJECTED

‚ùå **Numbers Don't Match**
- Test count, coverage %, workflow count must match between files

‚ùå **Tests < 35 or Any Failing**
- Need 35+ and 100% pass rate

‚ùå **Coverage < 80%**
- Must meet 80.00% minimum

‚ùå **Can't Reproduce**
- If my test run differs from yours

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT WILL CAUSE APPROVAL**

‚úÖ **All 10 Specific Workflows**
- Database query shows all 10 IDs
- Sample folder has all 10 files
- Summary shows 10/10 success

‚úÖ **All Evidence Exists**
- All 6 files/folders present

‚úÖ **Numbers Match**
- Evidence summary = test output = coverage report = database

‚úÖ **Tests Pass**
- 35+ tests, all passing when I run

‚úÖ **Coverage Meets**
- ‚â•80% when I run

‚úÖ **Reproducible**
- I get same results as you

---

## üìû **COMMUNICATION**

### **Questions to Ask:**

**Good:**
- "Should extraction script take workflow IDs as parameter or hardcode the 10?"
- "If workflow 2145 returns 404, should I retry or fail gracefully?"
- "Should I clear database before extraction or append?"

**You Already Asked (Answered):**
- ‚úÖ PM's brief location - See Master Orchestrator's message
- ‚úÖ Listing vs detail pages - Detail pages (individual workflows)
- ‚úÖ Real vs mocked tests - Mix (mostly mocked, 3-5 real)
- ‚úÖ How to get IDs - Use the provided list of 10
- ‚úÖ Database state - Append (don't clear)

---

**Task Issued:** October 10, 2025, 02:10 AM  
**Deadline:** October 11, 2025, 18:00  
**Time Available:** 40 hours  
**Work Needed:** 6-8 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Hours 1-2: Add 1-2 tests, increase coverage 77% ‚Üí 82%
- Hours 3-5: Extract 10 target workflows
- Hours 6-7: Create evidence files, verify
- Hour 8: Buffer/verification

## üí° **TIPS FOR SUCCESS**

**Do:**
‚úÖ Extract ONLY the 10 specific workflow IDs listed  
‚úÖ Watch tests run live before saving  
‚úÖ Verify ALL 10 in database before claiming  
‚úÖ Create ALL 10 sample JSONs  
‚úÖ Double-check numbers match  

**Don't:**
‚ùå Extract random workflows (use the 10 specified)  
‚ùå Claim 10/10 if database shows 9  
‚ùå Skip any evidence files  
‚ùå Exaggerate metrics
