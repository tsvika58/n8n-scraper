# 📋 **RND TASK ASSIGNMENT: SCRAPE-002B - PRODUCTION EXTRACTION**

**RND Task ID:** RND-SCRAPE-002B  
**PM Task Reference:** SCRAPE-002B - Production Metadata Extraction (100-200 Sales Workflows)  
**Assigned To:** Developer-1 (Dev1)  
**From:** RND Manager  
**Issued Date:** October 10, 2025, 16:25 PM  
**Expected Completion:** October 11, 2025, 20:00 PM  
**Estimated Effort:** 16 hours

---

## 🎯 **YOUR MISSION**

**Use your validated SCRAPE-002 extractor to extract complete metadata from 100-200 n8n.io sales/marketing workflows, store in database with ≥90% success rate, and provide comprehensive production evidence package.**

---

## 📚 **CONTEXT & REFERENCE**

### **Original PM Task Brief:**
- **Task:** SCRAPE-002B - Production Metadata Extraction
- **Notion:** https://www.notion.so/288d7960213a813389a0ff0202819416
- **Version:** Production scale-up of validated SCRAPE-002
- **Read this:** For complete business context and production requirements

### **What PM Wants:**
PM needs production-scale extraction of 100-200 sales/marketing/CRM workflows from n8n.io. You'll use your already-validated SCRAPE-002 extractor (approved at 77% coverage, 46 tests) to prove it works at production scale. This is the real production run - not validation, but actual dataset creation.

**Key Change from SCRAPE-002:**
- SCRAPE-002: 10 workflows (validation phase) ✅ Complete
- SCRAPE-002B: 100-200 workflows (production phase) ⏳ **This task**

### **What I Need From You:**
I need ACTUAL production evidence:
- 100-200 workflows in database (I'll query it)
- ≥90% success rate (I'll verify from your summary)
- 20+ sample extractions (I'll review quality)
- Complete failure analysis (I'll read it)
- Performance metrics (I'll verify timing)
- All evidence files (I'll check they exist)

**No modifications to SCRAPE-002 code** - use the approved extractor as-is.

### **Why This Matters:**
This proves your extractor works at production scale, creates actual usable dataset for sales/marketing analysis, and validates that the 77% coverage decision was correct (the extractor is robust enough for production).

## 🎯 **TARGET WORKFLOWS - HOW TO GET 100-200**

### **Approach: Category-Focused Extraction**

**Target Categories (Sales/Marketing Focus):**
1. Sales automation
2. Lead generation
3. Marketing automation
4. CRM integrations
5. Email marketing
6. Sales enablement
7. Customer engagement
8. Revenue operations

**Method:**
```
Option A: Sequential scan of workflow ID ranges
- Try ranges: 1500-1700, 1800-2000, 2200-2400
- Extract all that exist
- Filter for sales/marketing categories
- Target: 100-200 successful

Option B: Explore n8n.io by category
- Visit category pages (if available)
- Extract workflow IDs from listings
- Then extract metadata from each
- More targeted but requires exploration

Recommended: Option A (simpler, proven)
```

**Expected:**
- Attempt: 150-250 workflow IDs
- Success: 100-200 (accounting for 404s, non-sales workflows)
- Success rate: ~70-90%

---

#### **2. `SCRAPE-002B-failure-analysis.md`** ⭐ **REQUIRED**

**What it is:** Detailed analysis of any failures

**Format:**
```markdown
# SCRAPE-002B Failure Analysis

## Summary:
- Total failures: 15/180 (8.33%)
- Success rate: 91.67% (exceeds 90% target)

## Failure Breakdown:

### Workflow 1567:
- Error: 404 Not Found
- Reason: Workflow doesn't exist on n8n.io
- Action: Skipped (expected)

### Workflow 1823:
- Error: Timeout after 30s
- Reason: Page took too long to load
- Action: Retried, failed again, skipped

[Continue for all failures]

## Patterns:
- 404 errors: 10 workflows (don't exist)
- Timeouts: 3 workflows (slow pages)
- Parse errors: 2 workflows (malformed HTML)

## Conclusion:
91.67% success rate exceeds 90% target. Failures are expected 
(404s, timeouts) and were handled gracefully.

## 🔍 **YOUR SELF-VALIDATION (Before Submitting)**

### **Step 1: Verify Database Count (2 min)**
```bash
cd /Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/Code\ Projects/shared-tools/n8n-scraper

# Count workflows in database
sqlite3 data/workflows.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workflows WHERE workflow_id >= '1500';"
# Must show ≥100
```
- [ ] Database has 100+ workflows from production run

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Success Rate (5 min)**
```bash
# From your production run logs/summary
# Calculate: (successful / attempted) × 100
# Must be ≥90%
```
- [ ] Success rate ≥90%
- [ ] Documented in production-summary.json

---

### **Step 3: Create All Evidence Files (15-30 min)**
```bash
mkdir -p .coordination/testing/results/SCRAPE-002B-sample-extractions

# 1. Create production-summary.json (from your extraction logs)
# 2. Write failure-analysis.md (analyze all failures)
# 3. Write performance-report.md (timing and performance)
# 4. Create category-breakdown.json (group by category)
# 5. Copy 20+ samples to sample-extractions folder
# 6. Generate database-export.txt

# Verify all exist
ls -la .coordination/testing/results/SCRAPE-002B*
```

# - success_rate: calculated correctly
# - workflows_in_database: matches DB query
```
- [ ] All numbers are ACTUAL (not estimated)
- [ ] Success rate calculated correctly
- [ ] Database count matches summary

---

### **Step 5: Quality Check Samples (10 min)**

---

## 💡 **EXECUTION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Exploration (1-2 hours)**

**Identify target workflow ranges:**
```python
# Test a few ranges to find where sales/marketing workflows are
test_ranges = [
    range(1500, 1550),  # Test 50
    range(1800, 1850),  # Test 50
    range(2200, 2250),  # Test 50
]

# Extract samples from each range
# Analyze categories
# Identify which ranges have most sales/marketing
```

**Goal:** Find 3-5 ranges rich with sales/marketing workflows

---

### **Phase 2: Production Extraction (8-12 hours)**

**Run production script:**
```python
# Based on exploration, extract from identified ranges
target_ranges = [
    range(1500, 1700),  # ~200 IDs
    range(1800, 2000),  # ~200 IDs
    range(2200, 2400),  # ~200 IDs
]

total_attempted = 0
successful = 0

for wf_id in combine_ranges(target_ranges):
    result = extract_workflow(wf_id)
    total_attempted += 1
    if result:
        successful += 1
        store_in_database(result)
    
    # Stop when you have 100-200 successful
    if successful >= 150:
        break

success_rate = (successful / total_attempted) * 100
```

**With rate limiting:**
- 2s per workflow
- 150 workflows = ~300s extraction + ~300s delays = ~10 minutes
- Plus processing time = ~15-20 minutes total

**Goal:** 100-200 workflows stored with ≥90% success

---

### **Phase 3: Analysis & Documentation (2-4 hours)**

**Generate all evidence files:**
1. Create production summary JSON (from logs)
2. Write failure analysis (analyze each failure)
3. Write performance report (timing metrics)
4. Create category breakdown (group by category)
5. Select 20+ samples (diverse selection)
6. Export database records (verification)

**Goal:** Complete, professional evidence package

---

## ⏱️ **TIMELINE**

**Phase 1 (Exploration):** 1-2 hours  
**Phase 2 (Production):** 8-12 hours  
**Phase 3 (Documentation):** 2-4 hours

**Target Completion:** October 11, 2025, 16:00  
**Deadline:** October 11, 2025, 20:00  
**Buffer:** 4 hours

---

## 📞 **COMMUNICATION**

### **Progress Updates:**

**Required:** Update every 4 hours

**Format:**
```markdown
SCRAPE-002B Progress Update - [Time]

Phase: [Exploration/Production/Documentation]
Progress: [X/100-200 workflows]
Success rate: [XX%]
Issues: [Any problems]
ETA: [On track / Delayed]
```

**File:** `.coordination/handoffs/dev1-progress-SCRAPE-002B.md`

---

### **Questions to Ask:**

**Before Starting:**
- "Should I target specific categories or extract broadly?"
- "What if I can only get 95 workflows - acceptable?"
- "Should I prioritize certain workflow IDs?"

**During Execution:**
- "Hit rate limit block - should I pause?"
- "Success rate at 88% - continue or adjust?"
- "Found 120 workflows - continue to 200?"

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS METRICS**

**Complete when:**
- [ ] 100-200 workflows in database

- [ ] All 6 evidence files created
- [ ] No SCRAPE-002 code modifications
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Self-validation complete
- [ ] Submitted to RND
- [ ] **RND APPROVED**

---

## 💡 **TIPS FOR SUCCESS**

**Do:**
✅ Use SCRAPE-002 code as-is (already approved)  
✅ Track all failures (document thoroughly)  
✅ Monitor success rate (stop if falling below 90%)  
✅ Select diverse samples (show variety)  
✅ Calculate metrics honestly (no fabrication)  
✅ Update progress regularly (every 4 hours)  

**Don't:**
❌ Modify SCRAPE-002 extractor code  
❌ Skip failure analysis  
❌ Fabricate success rate  
❌ Skimp on documentation  
❌ Submit without all evidence
