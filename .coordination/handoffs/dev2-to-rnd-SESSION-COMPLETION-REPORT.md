## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

### **1. Database Architecture Matters**
Your observation about duplicate schemas led to significant architecture improvement. Always validate schema design early.

### **2. YouTube API Restrictions**
All programmatic methods are blocked. UI automation is the only viable approach for transcript extraction. This is a valuable finding for future projects.

### **3. Zero-Trust Validation Works**
Your requirement for honest metrics and independent verification caught issues early and resulted in higher quality deliverables.

### **4. Integration Testing is Critical**
Unit tests alone (30.99% coverage) weren't enough. Integration tests brought us to 58.60% with real-world validation.
