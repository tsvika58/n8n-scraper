# 📢 **IMPORTANT: NEW TASK PROCESS - ACTION REQUIRED**

**FROM:** RND Manager  
**TO:** Developer-1 (Dev1)  
**DATE:** October 10, 2025, 12:10 AM  
**SUBJECT:** New Task Assignment Process + SCRAPE-002 Status  
**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL - READ BEFORE ANY NEW WORK

---

## 🎯 **WHY I'M WRITING TO YOU**

Dev1, we're implementing a new task assignment and validation process effective immediately. This directly affects your current work (SCRAPE-002) and all future tasks.

**This is a positive change** that will make your job easier and prevent the confusion we experienced with SCRAPE-002.

---

## 📋 **WHAT'S CHANGING**

### **The Problems We Had with SCRAPE-002:**
- ❌ Unclear requirements (what "50 workflows" meant)
- ❌ Confusion about coverage target (77% vs 80%)
- ❌ No standard evidence format
- ❌ Unclear what "done" meant
- ❌ My failure to clarify before you started

### **The New Process Fixes:**
- ✅ Crystal-clear requirements with exact numbers
- ✅ Every requirement has verification command
- ✅ Standard evidence files you must create
- ✅ Self-validation checklist before submitting to me
- ✅ Clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ No ambiguity about completion

---

## 📚 **NEW TEMPLATE YOU'LL RECEIVE**

### **RND Task Assignment Template**
**Location:** `/Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/path58-coordination/n8n-scraper-project/templates/RND-TASK-ASSIGNMENT-TEMPLATE-v1.md`

**This is what every task will look like now:**

**Sections you'll see:**
1. **Your Mission** - One sentence: what to build
2. **Context & Reference** - Link to PM's original brief
3. **Your Deliverables Checklist** - Exact files to create
4. **Specific Requirements** - Each with verification command
5. **Quality Targets** - Coverage %, test count, etc.
6. **Testing Protocol** - How to run tests (watch them!)
7. **Self-Validation Checklist** - 7 steps before submitting
8. **Evidence Files Required** - 4+ standardized files
9. **What Causes Rejection** - Clear instant-reject criteria
10. **What Causes Approval** - Clear approval criteria

**Read time:** 20 minutes  
**Benefit:** No more confusion, faster approvals, less rework

---

## ✅ **WHAT YOU MUST DO NOW**

### **Action #1: Read the Template (20 min)**
```bash
# Open and read:
open /Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/path58-coordination/n8n-scraper-project/templates/RND-TASK-ASSIGNMENT-TEMPLATE-v1.md
```

**Focus on these sections:**
- **Self-Validation Checklist** (lines 218-294) - You'll do this before every submission
- **Evidence Files Required** (lines 67-137) - You'll create these every time
- **What Causes Rejection** (lines 405-428) - Know what to avoid
- **Testing Protocol** (lines 244-286) - How to run tests properly

---

### **Action #2: Understand Evidence Files**

**For EVERY task, you'll create 4+ files:**

1. **`[TASK-ID]-test-output.txt`**
   ```bash
   # How to create:
   pytest tests/[module] -v > .coordination/testing/results/[TASK-ID]-test-output.txt
   ```
   
2. **`[TASK-ID]-coverage-report.txt`**
   ```bash
   # How to create:
   pytest --cov=src.[module] --cov-report=term-missing > .coordination/testing/results/[TASK-ID]-coverage-report.txt
   ```
   
3. **`[TASK-ID]-sample-output.json`**
   - Example of your code's output
   
4. **`[TASK-ID]-evidence-summary.json`**
   - JSON with all metrics (template provided)

**All files go in:** `.coordination/testing/results/`

---

### **Action #3: Learn the Self-Validation Process**

**Before submitting work to me, you'll complete 7 steps:**

1. ✅ Verify code exists (ls commands)
2. ✅ Run tests and WATCH them (pytest -v)
3. ✅ Check coverage and WATCH output (pytest --cov)
4. ✅ Create all evidence files
5. ✅ Verify numbers match between files
6. ✅ Confirm all requirements met
7. ✅ Double-check everything

**Why:** I will independently verify all of this. If your self-validation is incomplete, instant rejection.

---

### **Action #4: Know Rejection Criteria**

**I will REJECT immediately if:**
- ❌ Missing evidence files
- ❌ Numbers don't match (claimed vs actual)
- ❌ Tests failing (even one)
- ❌ Coverage below target
- ❌ Can't reproduce your results
- ❌ Incomplete requirements
- ❌ "Almost done" (95% ≠ 100%)

**Why:** Protects project quality. Not personal. Fix and resubmit.

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: WATCH TESTS RUN**

### **New Rule You MUST Follow:**

**ALWAYS:**
```bash
# Step 1: Run tests and WATCH them
pytest tests/module -v

# Step 2: ONLY after seeing them pass, save to file
pytest tests/module -v > evidence-file.txt
```

**NEVER:**
```bash
# Bad: Can't see if tests are stuck
pytest tests/module -v > file.txt  # Don't do this first!
```

**Why:** You need to see tests running to know they're not stuck. This is mandatory now.

---

## 📊 **YOUR CURRENT WORK: SCRAPE-002**

### **Current Status:**
- Work submitted to me
- I'm awaiting PM clarification on requirements
- PM will provide clear task brief
- I'll create NEW task assignment using new template

### **What This Means for You:**

**When PM clarification comes:**
1. I'll create: `rnd-to-dev1-SCRAPE-002-TASK-ASSIGNMENT.md` (using new template)
2. You'll receive clear requirements with exact criteria
3. You'll know EXACTLY what to deliver
4. You'll use self-validation checklist
5. You'll create standard evidence files
6. Faster approval when you submit

**Timeline:** Waiting on PM (not your delay)

---

## 🎯 **SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR YOU**

### **Based on Your SCRAPE-002 Work:**

**What you did well:**
- ✅ Built working extractor (good code)
- ✅ Created comprehensive tests (34 tests)
- ✅ Honest reporting (all claims accurate)
- ✅ Professional code quality

**What was unclear (not your fault):**
- ⚠️ "50 workflows" requirement (PM unclear)
- ⚠️ Coverage target (77% vs 80%)
- ⚠️ Evidence file format
- ⚠️ What "done" meant

**New template prevents all of this:**
- ✅ Exact requirements (not "50 workflows" but specific)
- ✅ Coverage target clearly stated (e.g., "≥80%")
- ✅ Evidence files explicitly listed
- ✅ "Done" = checklist 100% complete

---

## 💡 **HOW THIS HELPS YOU**

### **Benefits of New Process:**

**1. No More Confusion**
- Every requirement is specific and measurable
- No guessing what's needed
- Clear verification commands provided

**2. Faster Approvals**
- If checklist complete → quick approval
- Self-validation catches issues early
- Less back-and-forth

**3. Less Rework**
- Clear requirements from start
- Know exactly what "done" means
- Avoid incomplete submissions

**4. Better Communication**
- Standard format everyone understands
- Questions answered upfront
- Reference to PM's original brief for context

**5. Professional Development**
- Learn proper validation techniques
- Build better testing habits
- Produce higher quality work

## 📝 **EXAMPLES FOR YOU**

### **How Tasks Will Look:**

**Old Way (Vague):**
> "Build Layer 1 extractor with good test coverage"

**New Way (Clear):**
> **Requirement #1: Test Coverage**
> - Minimum Required: 80%
> - How to check: `pytest --cov=src.scrapers.layer1_metadata`
> - Where to look: Line showing "layer1_metadata.py XX.XX%"
> - Pass: ≥80.00%
> - Fail: <80.00% = REJECTED

**See the difference?** No ambiguity!

---

### **How Evidence Will Look:**

**Old Way:**
- Random files with different formats
- Unclear what to include

**New Way:**
- `SCRAPE-002-test-output.txt` (standardized)
- `SCRAPE-002-coverage-report.txt` (standardized)
- `SCRAPE-002-sample-output.json` (structured)
- `SCRAPE-002-evidence-summary.json` (metrics JSON)

**See the difference?** Standard format!

## 💬 **PERSONAL NOTE**

Dev1,

The confusion with SCRAPE-002 was partly my fault - I didn't clarify requirements with PM before assigning to you. The new process prevents this.

**Your work quality is good.** The extractor you built works well, your tests are comprehensive, and your reporting was honest. The issue was unclear requirements, not your execution.

**This new process helps both of us:**
- **Helps you:** Clear requirements, no guessing
- **Helps me:** Standard validation, fair evaluation
- **Helps project:** Higher quality, fewer errors

**I'm committed to setting you up for success.** Read the template, ask questions, and you'll do great with the new process.

Looking forward to working with you on SCRAPE-002 rework using the new format.
