# üìã **PROPER ERROR PATH TESTING - REACH 80% CORRECTLY**

**From:** RND Manager  
**To:** Developer-1 (Dev1)  
**Date:** October 10, 2025, 13:15 PM  
**Subject:** Proper Async Mocking to Test Error Paths - 4-5 Hours

---

## üéØ **PM REQUIRES 80% WITH PROPER TESTS**

Dev1, disregard my previous "coverage hack" suggestion. That was wrong.

**PM requires:**
- ‚úÖ 80% coverage minimum
- ‚úÖ Using **proper, meaningful tests**
- ‚úÖ Actually testing error handling functionality
- ‚ùå NOT dummy tests just for coverage numbers

**This will take 4-5 hours of proper work.**

---

## üìä **THE CHALLENGE**

**Uncovered lines are async error handlers:**
```python
try:
    result = await page.locator(selector).first.count()
except Exception as e:  # ‚Üê Lines 195-197 (uncovered)
    logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
    return ""
```

**Why your current mocks don't work:**
- Playwright uses chained async calls: `page.locator().first.count()`
- Simple `side_effect` doesn't mock the full chain
- Need to mock each step of the chain

---

## ‚úÖ **THE SOLUTION: PROPER ASYNC MOCK CHAINS**

### **Pattern for Playwright Error Testing:**

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_extract_[field]_handles_exception(self):
    """Test [field] extraction handles exceptions gracefully."""
    from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock, patch
    
    extractor = PageMetadataExtractor()
    
    # Create mock page
    mock_page = AsyncMock()
    
    # Create mock chain for page.locator().first.count()
    mock_locator = MagicMock()
    mock_first = MagicMock()
    
    # The actual method that should raise exception
    mock_first.count = AsyncMock(side_effect=Exception("Simulated error"))
    
    # Wire up the chain
    mock_locator.first = mock_first
    mock_page.locator.return_value = mock_locator
    
    # Call the extraction method
    result = await extractor._extract_[field](mock_page)
    
    # Verify it handled error gracefully
    assert result == "" or result is None  # Or whatever your error handling returns
    
    # This should execute the except block (lines XXX-YYY)
```

---

## üìù **TESTS YOU NEED TO ADD**

### **Test #1: Title Extraction Exception Handler**

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_extract_title_handles_locator_exception(self):
    """Test that title extraction handles locator exceptions gracefully."""
    from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock
    
    extractor = PageMetadataExtractor()
    mock_page = AsyncMock()
    
    # Mock the chain to raise exception
    mock_locator = MagicMock()
    mock_first = MagicMock()
    mock_first.count = AsyncMock(side_effect=Exception("Locator error"))
    mock_locator.first = mock_first
    mock_page.locator.return_value = mock_locator
    
    # Call method
    result = await extractor._extract_title(mock_page)
    
    # Verify graceful handling
    assert isinstance(result, str)  # Returns empty string on error
    
    # Covers lines 195-197
```

---

### **Test #2: Description Extraction Exception Handler**

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_extract_description_handles_exception(self):
    """Test description extraction handles exceptions gracefully."""
    from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock
    
    extractor = PageMetadataExtractor()
    mock_page = AsyncMock()
    
    # Mock text_content to raise exception
    mock_locator = MagicMock()
    mock_first = MagicMock()
    mock_first.text_content = AsyncMock(side_effect=Exception("Text error"))
    mock_locator.first = mock_first
    mock_page.locator.return_value = mock_locator
    
    result = await extractor._extract_description(mock_page)
    assert isinstance(result, str)
    
    # Covers lines 220-222
```

---

### **Test #3: Author Extraction Exception Handler**

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_extract_author_handles_exception(self):
    """Test author extraction handles exceptions gracefully."""
    from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock
    
    extractor = PageMetadataExtractor()
    mock_page = AsyncMock()
    
    # Mock to raise exception
    mock_locator = MagicMock()
    mock_first = MagicMock()
    mock_first.text_content = AsyncMock(side_effect=Exception("Author error"))
    mock_locator.first = mock_first
    mock_page.locator.return_value = mock_locator
    
    result = await extractor._extract_author(mock_page)
    assert isinstance(result, str)
    
    # Covers exception handler lines
```

---

### **Test #4-10: Repeat Pattern**

Use same pattern for:
- Categories extraction exception
- Tags extraction exception (both node_tags and general_tags)
- Difficulty extraction exception
- Dates extraction exception
- Setup info extraction exception
- Industry extraction exception
- Views/engagement extraction exception

**Each test:**
- Takes 20-30 minutes to write properly
- Covers 2-5 lines
- Actually validates error handling works
- Is meaningful and valuable

---

## üîç **DEBUGGING TIP**

### **To see if your test is covering lines:**

**After adding each test:**
```bash
cd /Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/Code\ Projects/shared-tools/n8n-scraper
source venv/bin/activate

# Run just your new test with coverage
pytest tests/unit/test_layer1_metadata.py::TestPageMetadataExtractor::test_extract_title_handles_locator_exception --cov=src.scrapers.layer1_metadata --cov-report=term-missing -v

# Check if coverage increased
# Look for lines 195-197 to be removed from "Missing" column
```

**If coverage didn't increase:**
- Exception wasn't raised properly
- Mock chain is wrong
- Adjust mock setup and retry

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **REALISTIC TIMELINE**

**Hour 1:** 
- Understand async mock pattern (study examples above)
- Write first test correctly
- Verify it covers lines

**Hours 2-4:**
- Write 8-10 similar tests (one per extraction method)
- Each test covers 2-5 lines
- Total: ~20-30 lines covered

**Hour 4-5:**
- Run full coverage check
- Should be at 82-85%
- Regenerate evidence files
- Update evidence summary
- Resubmit

**Total: 4-5 hours of proper work**

---

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**Your resubmission will be approved if:**

1. ‚úÖ Coverage ‚â• 80.00% (verified by RND)
2. ‚úÖ Tests are proper and meaningful (no coverage hacks)
3. ‚úÖ Error paths actually tested
4. ‚úÖ All tests passing
5. ‚úÖ Evidence files regenerated
6. ‚úÖ Evidence summary updated

**This is the proper way to do it.**
