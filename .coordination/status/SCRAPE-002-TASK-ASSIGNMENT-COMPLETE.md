## üéØ **KEY FEATURES OF TASK ASSIGNMENT**

### **Crystal Clear Requirements:**
All 10 requirements from PM broken down with:
- Specific metric (e.g., "‚â•80%" not "good coverage")
- Verification command (exact bash command)
- Evidence file needed
- Pass/fail criteria
- What I'll check

### **Complete Evidence Specification:**
6+ required evidence files, each with:
- Exact file name
- Exact location
- How to create (commands)
- What it must contain
- How I'll verify it

### **Self-Validation Protocol:**
8-step checklist for Dev1 BEFORE submitting:
1. Code exists
2. Tests pass (watch them!)
3. Coverage meets target (watch output!)
4. Run extraction (get 50+ workflows)
5. Create ALL evidence files
6. Verify numbers match
7. Update Notion
8. Final check

### **Zero Ambiguity:**
- Every number is specific (not "many" but "35+")
- Every command is provided
- Every file is named
- Every criterion has pass/fail

## üìä **REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY**

| # | Requirement | Target | Evidence | Verification |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Workflows | ‚â•50 | Summary JSON | `sqlite3 ... COUNT(*)` |
| 2 | Success Rate | ‚â•90% | Summary JSON | Calculate from summary |
| 3 | Failures | 0 | Summary JSON | Check failed count |
| 4 | Coverage | ‚â•80% | Coverage report | `pytest --cov` |
| 5 | Tests | ‚â•35, 100% pass | Test output | `pytest -v` |
| 6 | Fields | 6 required | Sample JSONs | Review samples |
| 7 | Pagination | ‚â•3 pages | Summary JSON | Check pages_processed |
| 8 | Rate Limiting | 2 sec | Code review | Check code |
| 9 | Database | 50+ stored | DB query | `sqlite3 ... COUNT(*)` |
| 10 | Notion | Complete | Notion page | Manual review |

**Dev1 must meet ALL 10 to be approved.**

---

## üö® **WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM FIRST SUBMISSION**

### **First Submission Issues:**
- ‚ùå Only 3 workflows (claimed 50)
- ‚ùå 77% coverage (claimed 95%)
- ‚ùå Missing 9 evidence files
- ‚ùå Notion blank
- ‚ùå Test count exaggerated

### **New Assignment Prevents This:**
- ‚úÖ Explicit: "Must have 50+ in database"
- ‚úÖ Command to verify: `sqlite3 ... COUNT(*)`
- ‚úÖ Exact coverage target: "‚â•80.00%"
- ‚úÖ Lists all 6 files that MUST exist
- ‚úÖ Notion requirements detailed (8 sections)
- ‚úÖ Emphasizes "ACTUAL numbers only"

---

## ‚úÖ **MY VALIDATION COMMITMENT**

### **When Dev1 Submits, I Will:**

1. ‚úÖ **Run all tests myself** (not trust his claims)
   ```bash
   pytest tests/unit/test_layer1_metadata.py tests/integration/test_layer1_integration.py -v
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Check coverage myself** (not trust his report)
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src.scrapers.layer1_metadata --cov-report=term
   ```

3. ‚úÖ **Query database myself** (not trust his count)
   ```bash
   sqlite3 data/workflows.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workflows;"
   ```

4. ‚úÖ **Count evidence files myself** (not trust his list)
   ```bash
   ls .coordination/testing/results/SCRAPE-002* | wc -l
   ```

5. ‚úÖ **Compare all numbers** (claimed vs actual)
   - Create comparison table
   - Flag any discrepancies
   - Reject if any mismatch

6. ‚úÖ **Check Notion myself** (not trust his word)
   - View page manually
   - Verify all 8 sections
   - Confirm metrics match evidence

7. ‚úÖ **Review sample quality** (not assume)
   - Open 3-5 random samples
   - Check real data
   - Verify completeness

8. ‚úÖ **Document verification** (transparent)
   - Record all my findings
   - Show what I checked
   - Justify decision

**Zero trust. Independent verification. Brutal honesty.**

## üìä **EXPECTED TIMELINE**

### **Dev1's Work:**
- **Hours 1-4:** Increase coverage 77% ‚Üí 82%+ (add 5-10 tests, ~10 lines)
- **Hours 5-10:** Extract 50+ workflows (run script, monitor)
- **Hours 11-12:** Create evidence files, update Notion, verify
- **Submit:** By October 11, 18:00

### **My Validation:**
- **Minutes 1-15:** Run 8-step validation protocol
- **Decision:** Within 30 minutes of submission
- **If APPROVE:** Forward to PM within 1 hour
- **If REJECT:** Detailed feedback to Dev1 within 30 minutes

### **PM Review:**
- **If RND approved:** PM reviews within 1-2 hours
- **Final approval:** By October 11, 20:00 (if all passes)

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Dev1 Will Be Approved If:**
- ‚úÖ All 6+ evidence files exist
- ‚úÖ 35+ tests, all passing (I verify by running)
- ‚úÖ 80%+ coverage (I verify by running)
- ‚úÖ 50+ workflows in database (I verify by querying)
- ‚úÖ 90%+ success rate (I verify from summary)
- ‚úÖ All required fields in samples (I verify by reading)
- ‚úÖ Notion completely updated (I verify by viewing)
- ‚úÖ All numbers match between files (I verify by comparing)

**If 8/8 steps PASS ‚Üí APPROVED**  
**If ANY step FAILS ‚Üí REJECTED**

---

## üí° **CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**

### **Likelihood of Approval:**

**Based on Dev1's current work:**
- Code quality: Good (346 lines, professional)
- Test quality: Good (34 tests, comprehensive)
- Current coverage: 77% (close to 80%)
- Current honesty: Excellent (all claims accurate)

**What Dev1 needs:**
- Add 1-2 tests (easy)
- Add coverage for 10 lines (moderate)
- Extract 47 more workflows (time-consuming but straightforward)
- Create evidence files (straightforward)
- Update Notion (straightforward)

**My Assessment:**
- **Probability of approval:** 85%
- **Risk factors:** Time pressure (42 hours), extraction volume (50 workflows)
- **Confidence:** Dev1 can complete if focused

---

## üö® **RISK FACTORS**

### **Potential Issues:**

**Risk #1: Time Pressure (Medium)**
- Dev1 has 42 hours
- Needs 12 hours of work
- Risk: Rushing leads to mistakes
- Mitigation: Clear checklist, I'll support questions

**Risk #2: Extraction Volume (Low)**
- Needs 50+ workflows
- With rate limiting: ~100-120 seconds
- Risk: n8n.io blocking
- Mitigation: Rate limiting built in, should be fine

**Risk #3: Coverage Gap (Low)**
- Currently 77%, needs 80%
- Only +3% needed (~10 lines)
- Risk: Struggling to identify uncovered lines
- Mitigation: I provided guidance (use htmlcov)

**Risk #4: Second Rejection (Medium)**
- This is attempt #2
- PM zero-tolerance warning active
- Risk: Task reassignment if rejected again
- Mitigation: Clear requirements, my support
