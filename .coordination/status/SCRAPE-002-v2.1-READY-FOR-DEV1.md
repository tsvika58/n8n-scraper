## üéØ **KEY FEATURES OF v2.1 ASSIGNMENT**

### **Clear Scope - 10 Specific Workflows:**

**Exact List Provided:**
```

2. 1954 - Sales Email
3. 2103 - CRM Sync
4. 2234 - Email Campaign

10. 2145 - Sales Notifications
```

**No ambiguity:** Extract these 10, nothing else.

---

### **Updated Evidence Requirements:**

**6 Required Files:**
1. `SCRAPE-002-test-output.txt` (35+ tests)
2. `SCRAPE-002-coverage-report.txt` (‚â•80%)
3. `SCRAPE-002-10-workflow-summary.json` (metrics for 10)
4. `SCRAPE-002-sample-extractions/` **(MUST have all 10 files)**
5. `SCRAPE-002-database-query.txt` (10 specific IDs)
6. `SCRAPE-002-evidence-summary.json` (complete)

**Critical:** Sample folder must have EXACTLY 10 workflow JSON files.

---

### **Notion Corrected:**

**Removed:**
- ‚ùå "Update Notion completely"
- ‚ùå Notion validation step
- ‚ùå Notion sections checklist
- ‚ùå "Update Notion (10 min)" from self-validation

**Changed to:**
- ‚úÖ "Reference Notion (read-only)"
- ‚úÖ Read for task context only
- ‚úÖ No update burden on developer
- ‚úÖ No validation of Notion by RND

**Impact:** Dev1 focuses on deliverables only, not Notion management.

---

### **Validation Protocol - 7 Steps:**

1. ‚úÖ Evidence files exist (6 files + 10 in folder)
2. ‚úÖ Tests pass (run independently)
3. ‚úÖ Coverage ‚â•80% (run independently)
4. ‚úÖ Database has 10 specific IDs (query independently)
5. ‚úÖ Evidence summary accurate
6. ‚úÖ All 10 workflow files valid
7. ‚úÖ Numbers match (claimed vs actual)

**Decision:** 7/7 PASS = APPROVE, ANY fail = REJECT

## üí° **WHY THIS WORKS**

### **Unblocks Dev1 Immediately:**
- Clear list of 10 workflows (no discovery needed)
- All 10 verified to exist (Dev2 tested them)
- Focused scope (6-8 hours achievable)

### **Maintains Quality:**
- Same standards (80% coverage, 35+ tests)
- Same evidence rigor (6 files required)
- Same validation (7-step zero-trust)

### **Business Value:**
- All 10 are sales/lead gen workflows
- Validates on business-critical use cases
- Proves extractor before production scale

### **Sets Up for Scale:**
- SCRAPE-002: Validation on 10
- SCRAPE-001B: Build complete inventory
- SCRAPE-002B: Production scraping of all

## ‚úÖ **MY VALIDATION COMMITMENT**

**When Dev1 submits, I will:**

1. ‚úÖ Check all 6 evidence files exist
2. ‚úÖ Verify sample folder has EXACTLY 10 workflow files
3. ‚úÖ Run tests myself and watch them execute
4. ‚úÖ Run coverage myself and verify ‚â•80%
5. ‚úÖ Query database for the 10 specific workflow IDs
6. ‚úÖ Review 3-4 sample files for quality
7. ‚úÖ Compare all Dev1's claims vs my verification

**Decision:** 7/7 PASS = APPROVE, ANY fail = REJECT

**I will protect project quality with zero-trust validation.**

---

## üìä **CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**

### **Likelihood of Dev1 Success:**

**Based on current state:**
- Code: Good (346 lines, working)
- Tests: 34 (need 1 more) - Easy
- Coverage: 77% (need 80%) - Achievable (~10 lines)
- Workflows: Has extractor, just needs to run on 10 - Straightforward

**Gaps to close:**
- Add 1-2 tests (1 hour)
- Add coverage for 10 lines (1-2 hours)
- Extract 10 specific workflows (2-3 hours)
- Create evidence files (1 hour)
- Verify everything (1 hour)

**Total:** 6-8 hours (matches estimate)

**My Confidence:** 80% - Dev1 can complete this if focused

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **TIMELINE**

**Now:** Assignment ready  
**Next:** Deliver to Dev1 (your decision)  
**Dev1 work:** 6-8 hours  
**Dev1 deadline:** October 11, 18:00 (40 hours away)  
**Buffer:** 32 hours (plenty of time)

## üìû **AWAITING YOUR INSTRUCTION**

**Master Orchestrator, how should I proceed?**

**Option A:** You deliver assignment to Dev1
- You forward the file to Dev1
- Tell him it's updated (10 workflows, not 50)
- He starts immediately

**Option B:** I deliver to Dev1 (via coordination file)
- I notify him assignment is ready
- He reads from `.coordination/handoffs/`
- Starts immediately

**Either way, Dev1 can start within minutes.**
