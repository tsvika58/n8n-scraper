# 🐕 Scraper Watchdog - Keepalive System Complete

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

## 📋 Summary

Successfully implemented and deployed a comprehensive keepalive/watchdog system that monitors all scraping layers and automatically restarts them if they stop or stall.

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. **Started Layer 3 Scraper**
- Layer 3 was stuck (last update 3 hours ago at 12:44:55)
- Only processed 152/6,022 workflows
- ✅ Manually started Layer 3 scraper

### 2. **Created Scraper Watchdog System**
- **File**: `scripts/scraper_watchdog.py`
- **Purpose**: Automatically monitor and restart all scrapers
- **Features**:
  - Monitors Layer 1.5, Layer 2, and Layer 3
  - Checks if processes are running
  - Checks if processes are making progress
  - Automatically restarts stopped or stalled processes
  - Logs all activity to `/app/logs/watchdog.log`
  - Health checks every 5 minutes
  - Restarts if no progress for 10 minutes

### 3. **Created Easy Startup Script**
- **File**: `start_watchdog.sh`
- **Purpose**: Easy way to start/stop/monitor the watchdog

## 📊 Current Status

### All Scrapers Running:
```
✅ Layer 1.5: 3,814/6,022 (63.3%) - ETA: ~4.5 hours
✅ Layer 2:   5,758/6,022 (95.6%) - ETA: ~2.5 hours  
✅ Layer 3:   105/6,022 (1.7%)    - Just restarted
✅ Watchdog:  Monitoring all layers
```

### Overall Progress:
- **Total**: 9,676/18,066 (53.6%)
- **Layer 2 will finish first** in ~2.5 hours (21:24 Jerusalem time)
- **Layer 1.5 will finish** ~2 hours after Layer 2
- **Layer 3 is now actively processing** after being stuck

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start the Watchdog:
```bash
cd /Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/Code\ Projects/shared-tools/n8n-scraper
./start_watchdog.sh
```

### Monitor Watchdog Logs:
```bash
docker exec n8n-scraper-app tail -f /app/logs/watchdog.log
```

### Check Watchdog Status:
```bash
docker exec n8n-scraper-app ps aux | grep scraper_watchdog
```

### Stop Watchdog:
```bash
docker exec n8n-scraper-app pkill -f scraper_watchdog.py
```

### Monitor All Layers Progress:
```bash
docker exec n8n-scraper-app python /app/scripts/monitor_all_layers.py
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Watchdog Configuration:

**Layer 1.5**:
- Script: `/app/scripts/layer1_5_production_scraper.py --all`
- Table: `workflow_metadata`
- Progress Field: `layer1_5_extracted_at`

**Layer 2**:
- Script: `/app/scripts/run_layer2_production.py`
- Table: `workflows`
- Progress Field: `updated_at`
- Filter: `layer2_success = true`

**Layer 3**:
- Script: `/app/scripts/layer3_production_scraper.py`
- Table: `workflow_content`
- Progress Field: `layer3_extracted_at`

### Health Check Logic:
1. Check if process is running
2. Check timestamp of last update
3. Check if progress count is increasing
4. Restart if:
   - Process not found
   - No updates for 10+ minutes
   - Process crashed

## 📝 Logs

All watchdog activity is logged to:
```
/app/logs/watchdog.log
```

Sample log output:
```
2025-10-14 15:50:01 - INFO - 🐕 SCRAPER WATCHDOG STARTED
2025-10-14 15:50:01 - INFO - Monitoring scrapers: layer1_5, layer2, layer3
2025-10-14 15:50:03 - INFO - ✅ layer1_5 is healthy (progress: 3809 → 3810)
2025-10-14 15:50:05 - WARNING - ⚠️  layer2 has been stalled for 43646s
2025-10-14 15:50:05 - WARNING - 🔄 Restarting layer2 (Reason: stalled)
2025-10-14 15:50:11 - INFO - ✅ Started layer2 (PID: 63357, Restart #1)
```

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Automatic Recovery**: No manual intervention needed if scrapers crash
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Detects and fixes stalled processes
3. **Complete Visibility**: All activity logged with timestamps
4. **Resilient System**: Keeps scraping running 24/7
5. **Easy Management**: Simple scripts to start/stop/monitor

## 🎉 Result

**Before**: 
- Layer 3 stuck for 3 hours
- Manual monitoring required
- Risk of extended downtime

**After**:
- All layers running continuously
- Automatic restart on failure
- Self-healing system
- Complete observability

## 🔮 Next Steps

The watchdog will now:
1. Keep all scrapers running 24/7
2. Automatically restart any that fail
3. Log all activity for auditing
4. Provide health status every 5 minutes

**No further action required** - the system is self-maintaining!
