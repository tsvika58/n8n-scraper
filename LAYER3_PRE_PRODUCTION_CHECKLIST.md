# Layer 3 Pre-Production Checklist

## 🎯 **Critical Items to Validate BEFORE Production Scraper**

### ✅ **Already Tested & Validated**
1. ✅ Comprehensive extraction working (tested on 2 workflows)
2. ✅ Video URL extraction & storage (3 URLs extracted)
3. ✅ Video deduplication (6 duplicates removed, 67% reduction)
4. ✅ Transcript extraction (1 transcript, 4,339 chars)
5. ✅ Complete iframe crawling (43,329 chars extracted)
6. ✅ Multi-pass extraction (5/5 passes completed)
7. ✅ Database schema ready (38 columns, 13 indexes)
8. ✅ All indexes created (6 GIN + 7 B-tree)

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL ITEMS TO TEST NOW**

### 1. **Database Save Functionality**
**Status**: ❌ NOT TESTED YET
**Risk**: HIGH - We extracted data but haven't tested saving to database!

**Test Needed**:
- Extract data from 1 workflow
- Save to database
- Verify all fields populated correctly
- Check JSONB serialization works
- Verify arrays stored correctly

### 2. **Data Retrieval & Validation**
**Status**: ❌ NOT TESTED YET
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Need to ensure we can read back what we save

**Test Needed**:
- Read saved data from database
- Verify JSONB deserialization
- Check array retrieval
- Validate data integrity

### 3. **Resume Capability**
**Status**: ❌ NOT TESTED YET
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Need to avoid re-scraping completed workflows

**Test Needed**:
- Test skip logic for completed workflows
- Verify layer3_success flag works
- Test force re-scrape mode

### 4. **Error Handling & Recovery**
**Status**: ❌ NOT TESTED YET
**Risk**: HIGH - Production will encounter errors

**Test Needed**:
- Test behavior on network timeout
- Test behavior on missing content
- Test behavior on database connection loss
- Verify partial data doesn't corrupt database

### 5. **Performance & Resource Usage**
**Status**: ❌ NOT TESTED YET
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Could run out of resources on large scale

**Test Needed**:
- Memory usage over multiple workflows
- Browser cleanup between workflows
- Database connection pooling
- Transcript extraction timeout handling

### 6. **Edge Cases**
**Status**: ❌ NOT TESTED YET
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Edge cases will happen in production

**Test Needed**:
- Workflow with no videos
- Workflow with no iframes
- Workflow with broken/inaccessible iframe
- Workflow with very large content (>1MB)
- YouTube video with no transcript

## 📋 **RECOMMENDED TEST PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Database Integration Test** (CRITICAL)
1. Extract 1 workflow with comprehensive extractor
2. Save to database
3. Read back and validate
4. Verify all fields populated

### **Phase 2: Edge Case Testing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Test workflow with no videos
2. Test workflow with no transcript
3. Test workflow with broken iframe
4. Test workflow with huge content

### **Phase 3: Error Recovery Testing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Simulate network failure during extraction
2. Simulate database connection loss during save
3. Verify graceful degradation
4. Test resume from failure

### **Phase 4: Performance Testing** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Extract 10 workflows in sequence
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Monitor database connections
4. Verify cleanup happens correctly

### **Phase 5: Resume Testing** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Extract 5 workflows
2. Stop midway
3. Resume and verify skip logic
4. Test force re-scrape

## 🚨 **CRITICAL BLOCKERS**

These MUST be tested before production:

1. **Database Save/Load**: We've extracted but never saved to DB!
2. **Error Handling**: No error recovery tested
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Not verified browser/connection cleanup

---

## ✅ **MINIMUM VIABLE TESTS**

Before production scraper, we MUST at minimum:

1. ✅ Test database save/load (1 workflow)
2. ✅ Test error handling (1 failure scenario)
3. ✅ Test resume capability (skip completed workflow)

**Time estimate**: 15-30 minutes
**Risk if skipped**: HIGH - Could corrupt database or crash during production run

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

**DO NOT create production scraper yet.**

Instead:
1. Create database integration test (save + load)
2. Test 3-5 workflows with database save
3. Validate all data types stored correctly
4. Test resume capability
5. THEN create production scraper

**Why?** 
- We've tested extraction but NOT database integration
- Production scraper needs database save to work
- Better to find issues on 5 workflows than 6,000

**Alternative (Fast Track)**:
Create production scraper with built-in test mode that:
1. Runs on 10 workflows first
2. Validates database save/load
3. Checks all features work
4. THEN allows full production run

**Which approach do you prefer?**
