**🚀 L3 FULL SCRAPING MONITORING**

I have a Layer 3 scraper running on ALL 6,022 workflows in the database. The scraper is processing workflows with video discovery, transcript extraction, and L1.5 content extraction.

**Current Status:**
- Process: ✅ RUNNING
- Progress: 49/6,022 (0.8%)
- Content: 323 videos, 12 transcripts found
- Estimated completion: ~25 hours

**To monitor progress with live updates every 5 seconds:**
```bash
cd /Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/Code\ Projects/shared-tools/n8n-scraper && python scripts/live_l3_monitor.py
```

**For quick progress check:**
```bash
cd /Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/Code\ Projects/shared-tools/n8n-scraper && python scripts/monitor_l3_progress.py
```

**To check if process is running:**
```bash
ps aux | grep "layer3_enhanced_v2" | grep -v grep
```

**Expected output pattern:**
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Statistics: videos found, transcripts extracted
- Processing rate: ~500-600 workflows/hour
- Recent completions with timestamps
- Estimated completion time

The scraper processes 10 workflows per batch with 30-second delays between batches. Each workflow takes ~15 seconds to process.

**Key metrics to watch:**
- Success rate should be >90%
- Look for workflows with videos/transcripts found
- Monitor processing speed
- Check for any error patterns

**If process stops:**
- Check process status first
- Look for Python errors
- Restart if needed

**Files created:**
- `scripts/live_l3_monitor.py` - Live monitoring with 5s updates
- `scripts/monitor_l3_progress.py` - Quick progress check
- `TERMINAL_MONITORING_PROMPT.md` - Complete monitoring guide

Please monitor the progress and let me know if you see any issues or when it completes.
