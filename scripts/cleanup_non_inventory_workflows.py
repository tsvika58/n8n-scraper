Clean Up Non-Inventory Workflows

Deletes all workflows from the database that are NOT part of the official
6,022 workflow inventory from SCRAPE-002B.

This removes:
- Test workflows
- Invalid workflow IDs
- Accidentally created workflows
- Any workflows outside the inventory

Preserves:
- All 6,022 workflows from the official inventory
- All their associated data (metadata, structure, content, etc.)
