# Database Schema Improvements & Optimizations

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Schema Mismatches (Critical)**
- `Workflow` model expects `name` but tests use `title`
- `WorkflowNodeContext` model expects `id` but tests use `node_id`
- Field name inconsistencies across models

### 2. **Performance Issues**
- Missing indexes on frequently queried fields
- No connection pooling optimization
- Inefficient JSONB queries

### 3. **Data Integrity Issues**
- Missing foreign key constraints
- No data validation at database level
- Inconsistent data types

### 4. **Scalability Concerns**
- No partitioning strategy for large datasets
- Missing archiving mechanisms
- No data lifecycle management

## Proposed Improvements

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)

#### 1.1 Fix Schema Mismatches
```sql
-- Align field names across all models
ALTER TABLE workflows RENAME COLUMN name TO title;
ALTER TABLE workflow_node_contexts RENAME COLUMN id TO node_id;
ALTER TABLE workflow_standalone_docs RENAME COLUMN id TO doc_id;
```

#### 1.2 Add Missing Indexes
```sql
-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_workflows_extraction_status 
ON workflows (unified_extraction_success, layer2_scraped, layer3_scraped);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_workflows_created_at 
ON workflows (created_at);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_node_contexts_workflow_id 
ON workflow_node_contexts (workflow_id);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_standalone_docs_workflow_id 
ON workflow_standalone_docs (workflow_id);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_extraction_snapshots_workflow_layer 
ON workflow_extraction_snapshots (workflow_id, layer);

-- JSONB indexes for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_workflows_metadata_gin 
ON workflows USING GIN (metadata);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_node_contexts_position_gin 
ON workflow_node_contexts USING GIN (node_position);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_extraction_snapshots_payload_gin 
ON workflow_extraction_snapshots USING GIN (payload);
```

#### 1.3 Add Foreign Key Constraints
```sql
-- Ensure data integrity
ALTER TABLE workflow_node_contexts 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_node_contexts_workflow 
FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflows(workflow_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE workflow_standalone_docs 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_standalone_docs_workflow 
FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflows(workflow_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE workflow_extraction_snapshots 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_extraction_snapshots_workflow 
FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflows(workflow_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### Phase 2: Performance Optimizations

#### 2.1 Connection Pooling Optimization
```python
# Enhanced connection pool configuration
engine = create_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    poolclass=QueuePool,
    pool_size=50,              # Increased for production
    max_overflow=100,          # Increased overflow capacity
    pool_timeout=60,           # Increased timeout
    pool_recycle=1800,         # 30 minutes recycle
    pool_pre_ping=True,        # Validate connections
    echo=False,                # Disable SQL logging in production
    connect_args={
        "options": "-c default_transaction_isolation=read_committed"
    }
)
```

#### 2.2 Query Optimization
```sql
-- Optimized queries for common operations
CREATE VIEW workflow_extraction_summary AS
SELECT 
    w.workflow_id,
    w.title,
    w.url,
    w.unified_extraction_success,
    w.layer2_scraped,
    w.layer3_scraped,
    w.unified_extraction_at,
    COUNT(nc.id) as node_context_count,
    COUNT(sd.id) as standalone_doc_count,
    COUNT(es.id) as snapshot_count
FROM workflows w
LEFT JOIN workflow_node_contexts nc ON w.workflow_id = nc.workflow_id
LEFT JOIN workflow_standalone_docs sd ON w.workflow_id = sd.workflow_id
LEFT JOIN workflow_extraction_snapshots es ON w.workflow_id = es.workflow_id
GROUP BY w.workflow_id, w.title, w.url, w.unified_extraction_success, 
         w.layer2_scraped, w.layer3_scraped, w.unified_extraction_at;
```

#### 2.3 Batch Operations Optimization
```python
# Optimized batch operations
class OptimizedDatabaseManager:
    async def batch_upsert_workflows(self, workflows: List[Dict]) -> bool:
        """Optimized batch upsert with conflict resolution."""
        try:
            with get_session() as session:
                # Use PostgreSQL UPSERT (ON CONFLICT)
                stmt = insert(Workflow).values(workflows)
                stmt = stmt.on_conflict_do_update(
                    index_elements=['workflow_id'],
                    set_={
                        'title': stmt.excluded.title,
                        'description': stmt.excluded.description,
                        'updated_at': func.now()
                    }
                )
                session.execute(stmt)
                session.commit()
                return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Batch upsert failed: {e}")
            return False
```

### Phase 3: Data Architecture Improvements

#### 3.1 Data Partitioning Strategy
```sql
-- Partition workflows table by extraction date
CREATE TABLE workflows_2024 PARTITION OF workflows
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

CREATE TABLE workflows_2025 PARTITION OF workflows
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2026-01-01');

-- Partition extraction snapshots by layer
CREATE TABLE extraction_snapshots_l2 PARTITION OF workflow_extraction_snapshots
FOR VALUES IN ('L2', 'L2V2');

CREATE TABLE extraction_snapshots_l3 PARTITION OF workflow_extraction_snapshots
FOR VALUES IN ('L3', 'L3V3', 'UNIFIED');
```

#### 3.2 Data Archiving Strategy
```sql
-- Archive old completed workflows
CREATE TABLE workflows_archive (LIKE workflows INCLUDING ALL);

-- Archive old extraction snapshots
CREATE TABLE extraction_snapshots_archive (LIKE workflow_extraction_snapshots INCLUDING ALL);

-- Archive procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION archive_old_workflows()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Archive workflows older than 1 year
    INSERT INTO workflows_archive 
    SELECT * FROM workflows 
    WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year' 
    AND unified_extraction_success = true;
    
    DELETE FROM workflows 
    WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year' 
    AND unified_extraction_success = true;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 3.3 Data Validation & Constraints
```sql
-- Add data validation constraints
ALTER TABLE workflows 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_workflow_id_format 
CHECK (workflow_id ~ '^[0-9]+$');

ALTER TABLE workflows 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_url_format 
CHECK (url ~ '^https://n8n\.io/workflows/');

ALTER TABLE workflow_node_contexts 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_confidence_range 
CHECK (match_confidence >= 0 AND match_confidence <= 1);

ALTER TABLE workflow_standalone_docs 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_confidence_range 
CHECK (confidence_score >= 0 AND confidence_score <= 1);
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

#### 4.1 Full-Text Search
```sql
-- Add full-text search capabilities
ALTER TABLE workflows 
ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;

CREATE INDEX idx_workflows_search 
ON workflows USING GIN (search_vector);

-- Update search vector trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_workflow_search_vector()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.search_vector := 
        setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.title, '')), 'A') ||
        setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.description, '')), 'B');
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_workflow_search_vector
    BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON workflows
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_workflow_search_vector();
```

#### 4.2 Data Analytics & Reporting
```sql
-- Analytics views for reporting
CREATE VIEW extraction_analytics AS
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as extraction_date,
    COUNT(*) as total_workflows,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE unified_extraction_success = true) as successful_extractions,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE layer2_scraped = true) as layer2_completed,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE layer3_scraped = true) as layer3_completed,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (unified_extraction_at - created_at))) as avg_extraction_time_seconds
FROM workflows
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)
ORDER BY extraction_date DESC;

-- Performance metrics view
CREATE VIEW performance_metrics AS
SELECT 
    'Node Contexts' as metric_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_count,
    AVG(match_confidence) as avg_confidence,
    MIN(match_confidence) as min_confidence,
    MAX(match_confidence) as max_confidence
FROM workflow_node_contexts
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Standalone Docs' as metric_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_count,
    AVG(confidence_score) as avg_confidence,
    MIN(confidence_score) as min_confidence,
    MAX(confidence_score) as max_confidence
FROM workflow_standalone_docs;
```

#### 4.3 Data Quality Monitoring
```sql
-- Data quality monitoring
CREATE VIEW data_quality_metrics AS
SELECT 
    'Workflows' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE title IS NULL OR title = '') as missing_titles,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE url IS NULL OR url = '') as missing_urls,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE description IS NULL OR description = '') as missing_descriptions
FROM workflows
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Node Contexts' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE node_name IS NULL OR node_name = '') as missing_names,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sticky_content IS NULL OR sticky_content = '') as missing_content,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE match_confidence IS NULL) as missing_confidence
FROM workflow_node_contexts;
```

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Maintenance

#### 5.1 Database Monitoring
```sql
-- Monitor database performance
CREATE VIEW database_performance AS
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_tup_ins as inserts,
    n_tup_upd as updates,
    n_tup_del as deletes,
    n_live_tup as live_tuples,
    n_dead_tup as dead_tuples,
    last_vacuum,
    last_autovacuum,
    last_analyze,
    last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY n_live_tup DESC;
```

#### 5.2 Automated Maintenance
```sql
-- Automated maintenance procedures
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION perform_maintenance()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Update statistics
    ANALYZE workflows;
    ANALYZE workflow_node_contexts;
    ANALYZE workflow_standalone_docs;
    ANALYZE workflow_extraction_snapshots;
    
    -- Clean up old data
    DELETE FROM workflow_extraction_snapshots 
    WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
    
    -- Archive old workflows
    PERFORM archive_old_workflows();
    
    -- Vacuum tables
    VACUUM ANALYZE workflows;
    VACUUM ANALYZE workflow_node_contexts;
    VACUUM ANALYZE workflow_standalone_docs;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
