## 🤝 PM ↔ RND PROTOCOL ESTABLISHED

### **Daily Workflow**

#### **Morning (9:00 AM) - PM Responsibilities**
```
1. Read .coordination/daily/status.json (2 min)
2. Read .coordination/handoffs/rnd-to-pm.md (5 min)
3. Review yesterday's test results (3 min)
4. Update .coordination/handoffs/pm-to-rnd.md (10 min)
5. Quick Slack check-in with RND (5 min)

Total: ~30 minutes
```

#### **Evening (6:00 PM) - RND Responsibilities**
```
1. Update .coordination/handoffs/rnd-to-pm.md (15 min)
2. Update .coordination/daily/status.json (5 min)
3. Save test results to testing/results/ (5 min)
4. Push code + coordination files to git (5 min)

Total: ~30 minutes
```

**Key Principle:** Asynchronous file-based communication with daily sync points

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY DEFINED

### **3-Level Testing Approach**

#### **Level 1: Unit Testing (Continuous)**
- **Purpose:** Validate individual components
- **Target:** 80%+ coverage
- **Run:** On every commit (pre-commit hook)
- **Duration:** <5 minutes
- **Focus:** PageExtractor, WorkflowExtractor, ExplainerExtractor, Processors

#### **Level 2: Integration Testing (Daily + Quality Gates)**
- **Purpose:** Validate components work together
- **Scope:** 50 workflows tested daily
- **Run:** EOD + before quality gates
- **Duration:** ~30 minutes (parallelized)
- **Target:** 95%+ success rate

#### **Level 3: Scale Testing (End of Sprint)**
- **Purpose:** Production readiness validation
- **Scope:** 500 → 1,000 → 2,100 workflows
- **Run:** Days 10, 13, 16-18
- **Metrics:** Success rate, avg time, memory, errors
- **Target:** 95%+ success, <35s avg time

## 🎯 KEY FILES TO TRACK

### **Daily Updates (by RND EOD):**
1. `.coordination/daily/status.json` - Current state
2. `.coordination/handoffs/rnd-to-pm.md` - Progress update
3. `.coordination/testing/results/YYYYMMDD-test-summary.json` - Test results

### **Daily Review (by PM Morning):**
1. Read the 3 files above
2. Update `.coordination/handoffs/pm-to-rnd.md` with next priorities
3. Sync critical updates to Notion

### **Weekly:**
- Sprint progress review
- Quality gate evaluation
- Timeline adjustment if needed

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **For Lightweight Coordination:**

**✅ DO:**
- Keep handoff files updated daily
- Use evidence-based updates (metrics, test results)
- Flag blockers immediately
- Maintain quality gate discipline
- Focus on what matters

**❌ DON'T:**
- Create unnecessary process overhead
- Skip daily coordination updates
- Wait until end of sprint to test
- Ignore quality gate failures
- Over-engineer the coordination

---
