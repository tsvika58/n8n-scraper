Hi! Start production scraping of 6,022 n8n.io workflows with sticky terminal monitoring.

**System Ready:**
- Location: `/Users/tsvikavagman/Desktop/Code Projects/shared-tools/n8n-scraper`
- Container: `n8n-scraper-app` (running)
- Database: Clean slate, 6,022 workflows ready
- Scraper: Unified system (100% validated)

**Create script:** `scripts/scrape_all_production.py`

**Must include:**
1. Sticky progress bar at terminal bottom (ANSI codes: `\033[s\033[9999;0H\033[K...\033[u`)
2. Logs flow above progress bar
3. Show: Progress bar, %, Done: X/6,022, Failed, Current ID, Status, Elapsed, ETA, Jerusalem time
4. Use: `UnifiedWorkflowExtractor` with `save_to_database()` after each extraction
5. Process all 6,022 workflows sequentially
6. Handle errors gracefully (continue on failures)

**Reference:** See `scripts/validate_7_workflows_production.py` lines 96-104 for sticky progress implementation.

**Run:** `docker exec n8n-scraper-app python scripts/scrape_all_production.py`

Start scraping now with full visual monitoring!
