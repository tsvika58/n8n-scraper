# Layer 3 Issues Identified

## ðŸš¨ **Known Issues**

### **Issue 1: Extraction Timeout/Slowness**
- **Symptom**: Extraction takes 50-60 seconds per workflow
- **Cause**: Too many passes, too much content discovery
- **Impact**: Would take ~100 hours for 6,000 workflows
- **Priority**: HIGH

### **Issue 2: Database Save Failures**
- **Symptom**: Save attempts are timing out or failing silently
- **Cause**: Likely JSONB serialization or array handling issues
- **Impact**: Can't save extracted data
- **Priority**: CRITICAL

### **Issue 3: Element Handling Errors**
- **Symptom**: "dict object has no attribute '_object'" errors
- **Cause**: Playwright element garbage collection
- **Impact**: Some workflows fail extraction
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (handled with fallbacks)

### **Issue 4: Text Extraction Warnings**
- **Symptom**: "The object has been collected to prevent unbounded heap growth"
- **Cause**: Storing too many element references
- **Impact**: Text content not fully extracted
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (falls back to stored text)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Root Causes**

1. **Over-engineering**: 5 passes is too much, causing slowness
2. **Element Storage**: Storing Playwright elements causes garbage collection issues
3. **Database Complexity**: Too many fields to populate in one go
4. **No Error Visibility**: Errors happening but not being reported clearly

## ðŸ’¡ **Solutions Needed**

### **Solution 1: Simplify Extraction (Speed)**
- Reduce from 5 passes to 2-3 passes
- Skip validation pass (screenshots not needed)
- Combine visual + DOM in one pass
- Only extract what we need for database

### **Solution 2: Fix Database Save (Critical)**
- Test JSONB serialization separately
- Test TEXT[] array handling separately
- Add proper error logging
- Create minimal save test first

### **Solution 3: Improve Element Handling**
- Extract data immediately, don't store elements
- Use BeautifulSoup for static content
- Only use Playwright for dynamic/iframe content

### **Solution 4: Better Error Reporting**
- Add detailed error logging
- Print errors immediately
- Don't hide failures
- Add validation after each step

## ðŸ“‹ **Action Plan**

1. âœ… Create simple database save test (no extraction)
2. âœ… Fix database save issues
3. âœ… Simplify extractor (2-3 passes max)
4. âœ… Test on 1 workflow (extraction + save + validation)
5. âœ… Test on 5 workflows (stability check)
6. âœ… Commit working code
7. âœ… Run full scrape
