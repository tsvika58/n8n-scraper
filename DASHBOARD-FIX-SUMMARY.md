# Real-Time Dashboard Fix Summary

## Problem
The dashboard was showing "idle" during live scraping tests because the session tracking was hardcoded to 0.

## Solution Implemented
Updated `scripts/realtime-dashboard-enhanced.py` to track the **current session** (last 5 minutes of activity):

1. Added SQL query to get session stats from workflows extracted in the last 5 minutes
2. Updated the `live_scraping` section to use these real session stats instead of hardcoded zeros

## Changes Made

### Added Session Stats Query (line ~161)
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE quality_score > 0) as session_success,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE error_message IS NOT NULL AND error_message != '') as session_failed,
    0 as session_empty,
    COUNT(*) as session_total
FROM workflows 
WHERE extracted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```

### Updated Live Scraping Response (line ~286)
```python
'current_session_success': session_stats['session_success'] or 0,
'current_session_failed': session_stats['session_failed'] or 0,
'current_session_empty': session_stats['session_empty'] or 0,
'current_session_total': session_stats['session_total'] or 0
```

## How to Test

### 1. Restart the Dashboard
```bash
# Kill old dashboard
docker exec n8n-scraper-app pkill -f realtime-dashboard

# Wait 2 seconds
sleep 2

# Start new dashboard in background
docker exec n8n-scraper-app python /app/scripts/realtime-dashboard-enhanced.py &
```

### 2. Open Dashboard
Open http://localhost:5001 in your browser

### 3. Run Live Scraping Test
```bash
docker exec n8n-scraper-app python /app/scripts/simple_live_test.py
```

### 4. Watch the Dashboard
You should now see:
- **LIVE SCRAPING STATUS** section showing active scraping
- Progress bar updating with success/failed/empty/pending counts
- Live session showing "5 / 5 workflows" (or current progress during scraping)
- After completion, stats persist for 5 minutes before resetting to idle

## Expected Behavior

### During Scraping
- Live progress bar shows: Green (success), Red (failed), Orange (empty), Gray (pending)
- Live session text: "5 / 5 workflows" or current progress
- Legend shows live counts for each category

### After Scraping (within 5 minutes)
- Progress bar shows completed session stats
- Live session persists showing final counts
- After 5 minutes, dashboard returns to idle state

### Idle State
- Progress bar shows 100% gray (pending)
- Live session text: "0 / 0 workflows"
- All legend counts show 0

## Files Modified
- `scripts/realtime-dashboard-enhanced.py` (lines 161-172, 286-289)
- `scripts/simple_live_test.py` (created for easy testing)

## Next Steps
1. Manually restart the dashboard using the commands above
2. Run the simple live test
3. Watch the dashboard update in real-time
4. Verify the live progress bar shows session activity for 5 minutes after completion
