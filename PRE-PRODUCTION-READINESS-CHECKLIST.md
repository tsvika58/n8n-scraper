---

### 5. DATA QUALITY & VALIDATION (🔴 NOT TESTED)
- ❌ Quality scorer NOT updated for 7 layers
- ❌ Validation logic NOT tested with new data
- ❌ Data completeness NOT measured
- ❌ Field extraction accuracy NOT validated

**Required Actions:**
1. Update quality scorer to handle 7 layers
2. Test validation with sample data
3. Measure data completeness metrics
4. Validate field extraction accuracy

---

### 6. ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY (🔴 NOT TESTED)
- ❌ Error handling NOT tested with layer 4-7 failures
- ❌ Recovery mechanisms NOT validated
- ❌ Cleanup scripts NOT updated
- ❌ Rollback procedures NOT tested

**Required Actions:**
```bash
# Test comprehensive error handling
docker exec n8n-scraper-app python /app/scripts/production_safe_error_test.py

# Verify cleanup works
# Test rollback scenario
```

---

### 7. PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY (🔴 NOT BENCHMARKED)
- ❌ Processing time per workflow NOT measured with 7 layers
- ❌ Memory usage NOT profiled
- ❌ Database query performance NOT tested
- ❌ Batch processing NOT optimized
- ❌ Rate limiting NOT adjusted

**Current Known:**
- Single workflow: ~14-17 seconds
- Unknown: Impact on batch processing
- Unknown: Database performance with new tables

**Required Actions:**
```bash
# Performance benchmark
docker exec n8n-scraper-app python /app/scripts/batch_optimization_test.py

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats n8n-scraper-app
```

---

## ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Recommended Before Production)

### 8. DOCUMENTATION
- ❌ Database schema documentation NOT updated
- ❌ API documentation NOT updated
- ❌ Field descriptions NOT documented
- ❌ Usage examples NOT created

### 9. BACKUP & DISASTER RECOVERY
- ❌ Comprehensive backup NOT taken
- ❌ Restore procedure NOT tested
- ❌ Rollback plan NOT documented

### 10. LEGAL & COMPLIANCE
- ❌ Data retention policy NOT updated
- ❌ Privacy considerations NOT reviewed

   - Validate all 7 layers
   - Measure performance

2. **UPDATE MONITORING** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Update dashboards for 7 layers
   - Test real-time updates
   - Verify metrics

3. **FINALIZE INFRASTRUCTURE** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Backup database
   - Rebuild containers
   - Test full restart

4. **VALIDATE QUALITY** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Update quality scorer
   - Test error handling
   - Measure data completeness

---

## 📝 NOTES

- **Original Pre-Scraping Prep**: We had 20 workflow tests, full monitoring, backed up database, tested error handling, and production-ready infrastructure
- **Current State**: We have 1 workflow test, outdated monitoring, manually updated database, and untested infrastructure
- **Gap**: We are NOT at the same level of readiness as before

**Recommendation**: Complete Phases 1-2 (Core Validation + Infrastructure) before any production scraping.
